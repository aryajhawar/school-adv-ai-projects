"Definitely one of the worst sequels I've ever played. I can't for the life of me understand why people even like this game, let alone consider it better than the amazing first title. In stark contrast to the first game's fairly consistent pacing, minimalist story-telling, abundance of loot (and not to mention loot crates containing them), and loads and loads of locations (including multiple large hub levels), this **** sequel has about 1/4 of the loot (loot crates are bewilderingly rare in this game, to the point that I could only find 2 of the more valuable red crates in the whole damn game, compared to dozens being appropriately littered throughout every level in the first game!), much fewer locations (maybe like 2 or 3 hub levels compared to double that in the first), and an attempt at a more cohesive story with more of a pronounced 3 act structure which fails miserably because having voice actors talking directly into your head over the radio the whole damn game is more annoying than anything, especially with the cringe-inducing black comedy direction this game decided to catapult itself into (much like how the MCU firmly committed to being non-stop jokey crap after ""Thor 3""). Just awful. I'll play it co-op with my friends any day, but the sheer chore of starting any new playthrough really discourages me from that anyway. I'd give the first game a solid 9/10, easy. This one is just not much fun outside of very small pockets in co-op, and the lack of any decent loot really makes this a low bar for looter shooters in my opinion. This game almost actively punishes the player with lots of empty levels, poorly paced quests that are much worse on subsequent playthroughs, and an insulting lack of loot that practically spits in the face of sensible game design. Someone please explain to me why people like this game? This should've been getting **** only fans of the first game from jump. Instead, it's yet another sequel that we allowed to push its series into bad habits.",1,XBOX 360
"The game is full of references, black humor and absurd moments.Side questes are often more fun than the main story.",0,XBOX 360
"Very nice shooter, in particular two players split screen it's pure fun! You will spend many time to kill enemies, but also to choose what characteristic of your player you would improve (with 2 different methods: level (big improvement) and token (small but frequent improvement)!. To mention the time you'll spend to find the perfect weapon! Spoiler: you'll never find it ha ha ha!!! Number of bullet, fire frequency, time for reload, damage will always allow you to find a better weapon with games progress. That's a must have with any doubt!",9,XBOX 360
"You know how people say that they play single player instead of multiplayer for a calmer gaming experience? Yeah that's not this game. I have no idea why they couldn't put checkpoints after each mission objective is completed or something. Instead, they leave reloading stations which charge you money every time which is great in theory. But what happens when there's glitches like a door not opening after a bossfight? Well that **** for you cause you have to do the bossfight all over again. Don't get me started on the mission at the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve. I've just finished the fourth bossfight after doing the first three like four times. I redid all the bossfights because the game glitched and decided not to open the doors, making me reload the game, redo the bossfights, finish what was hopefully the last bossfight only for that bossfight to end with the health bar disappearing, the objective not completing and no doors opening. You want a game that will drain the life out of you? Play Borderlands 2",2,XBOX 360
"Very bitter-sweet, similar to BL1. The world is vast and diverse, but exploration is made very dull by omnipresent garbage loot, very few interesting NPCs, and repetitive (and respawning) enemies. Regrettably, the game doesn't do much to engage the player emotionally with its main protagonists either, and it took me almost until the end of the game to actually start to care about them. Still, the world is beautifully designed and combat is reasonably fun, so it wasn't too bad an experience.",6,XBOX 360
"The highest point of the franchise, Borderlands 2 presents so much content that impresses.Your stylized graphics, your fluid gameplay, your acid humor and creative quests make experience a real roller coaster of fun.Play with friends.",9,XBOX 360
"I still don't understand how a game with such insufferable dialogue, that is such a product of it's time that it almost removes the nostalgia for the early 2010's, can give some of the best looter shooter gameplay out there at the same time",9,XBOX 360
"The best game in history, the best villain in history with the best name for a horse",10,XBOX 360
"Note 9.7/10, good secondary missions and great main history!but I feel that something is missing in the game, besides the lack of subtitle in pt br",10,XBOX 360
its just so horribly made. the graphics hurt my eyes. the guns feel horrid to shoot. and the world is empty and boring. stop praising stupid games.,3,XBOX 360
my **** character got corrupted **** you randy fix your **** game!!!!,0,XBOX 360
"Best looter shooter i have played. Its a perfect sequel doubling down on everything, expanding, and improving its systems. Story is solid, handsome jack is a really fun villain and a lot of the characters here are memorable enough, with fun facts, like tina and her lazy eye. The main problem is the lack of acknowledgement of the vault hunter a lot of times when you do something they take the credit, especially in the ending even tho you are really fundamental to everything you are seen as a mere tool, that is also a 4 man army. Gameplay is incredible, sound design isnt the best but aside from that it has really good atributes, incredible gunplay, gun variety and design, that makes you play the game in various aproaches along with lots of enviroments, snow, hills, deserts and wastelands with varying color palette and ageless art style of sobel. Good enemy variety robots, bandits, psychos each with its own unique enemies, goliaths, constructors, drones and badasses, my only gripe is that you might be fighting robots most of the time (main campaign). Soundtrack isnt really memorable there is a couple good ones but nothing that stands out. Classes are really good, varied with a lot of potential and playstyles and techniques to learn. DLC is really good (except hammerlock one). Tons of easter eggs to games movies comics and books. And not only as cheap as 10$ it has a lot of replay value and lot of content. Farming is mostly optional but rewarding AF and satisfactory too. And there is some unintentional techniques that enhances the game like rocket jumping. Some issues are incredibly unbalanced endgame where you really need to know the game to survive, and limits a lot your build potential and makes raid bosses something almost impossible without glitching or cheesing. Characters sometimes can be so broken they are boring. A lot of weapons are unusuable in UVHM. Conection issues from time to time. Lacks a lot of qol stuff that is in 3. A lot of side missions feel unrewarding. Vehicles could be better. Shops and slot machines are interesting but needs better rewards or better probability (shops feel a lot better in TPS). Altough humor is pretty nice a lot of times there is cringe and toilet jokes.",8,XBOX 360
"this is a perfection of the borderlands 1 formula the gameplay is even better It doesn't have character building issues because the trees are so much better balanced every character is very fun to play with and doesn't feel super constricting to one play style and it has the best loot system I have ever seen as well the 360 version is very well optimized for playing with poor Wi-Fi this game has so much flavor and so much heart in it it's unbelievable, just an amazing game something that I would recommend playing through but I will warn the final boss is a little bit of a pushover",9,XBOX 360
BL2 is a super fun looter shooter. It also features one of the best written video game villains ever.,9,XBOX 360
Borderlands 2 is a chaotic experience filled with all kinds of humor that keeps you more engaged as you play more.,8,XBOX 360
Absolute bomb! A must play! I devoured everything from this game. Grab a friend and reek some havoc!,10,XBOX 360
"major QoL gameplay improvements over BL1. Has the best story in the series, and better pacing than BL3, but the gunplay is not satisfying as BL1 or BL3. It's good as a standalone first-time intro to the series, very immersive and arguably the best multiplayer experience too.",9,XBOX 360
- D.A incredible and unique - RPG/Hack'N'Slash Génial - Story engaging with a good touch of humor and seriousness - The beautiful Jack is great - DLC very nice,10,XBOX 360
"The game starts good and with a little bit of funny humor, after that it takes too long to kill with short amount of ammo too much enemies, then repeating, you have to start from places where you already went, you get lost and you lose yourself, the map in this game helps in the beginning but in the middle of the game it's nearly impossible to find your right destination because the places are too huge. I hope that games like this will not be produced again because i already played 10 years before this game came out excellent games like Zelda Ocarina of time that were worth to play.",3,XBOX 360
Good game but completing the game for 3 times to get all levels and content is not for me,8,XBOX 360
"A product of it's time, but in it's time it was like nothing else. Too much time played in smelly basements next too friends to rate it as poorly as its held up.",7,XBOX 360
Mano love this game I have thirty days in it and still play the replay factor of this game and impecáve,10,XBOX 360
The reason why I gave this a seven is because I really wasn’t in to the borderlands games this game was really just not for me,7,XBOX 360
"A boothare shooter of the best, with characters that know how to stand out for their very varied personalities, plenty",9,XBOX 360
Really fun game! Handsome Jack was a funny character and the story was nice.,10,XBOX 360
Fun but very long.,6,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2, while a solid entry in the series, didn't quite capture my heart the way the first game did. It seemed like the weapon generation system was a bit less refined, resulting in weapons that felt of lower quality and with less attention to detail. Additionally, I remember that the inventory menu was somewhat more complicated compared to the first game, which made item management less straightforward.However, the standout feature of this game is undoubtedly the antagonist, Handsome Jack. He is a villain who's both wicked and incredibly charismatic, adding depth and intrigue to the storyline. Despite my reservations about certain changes, the presence of Handsome Jack and his dynamic character brought a unique and enjoyable element to the game.",8,XBOX 360
Amazing FPS loot game that contains endless fun. Krieg is my baby :3,8,XBOX 360
"If I gave ChatGPT a prompt to generate the most average FPS in existence, it would probably be this. Nothing remarkable, no stakes or real purpose, just shooting up funny bad guys with pretty cool graphics. Probably won't keep your attention too much, but it can be fun.",8,XBOX 360
"Best part of the series. The look is beautiful, the story hilarious and the gameplay nearly perfect. Overall rating: 9.1.",9,XBOX 360
"Graphics are stunning, but controls are clunky.",10,XBOX 360
"While undeniably possessing the strongest levels of writing and characterization among any game in the mainline series, I would humbly argue that BL2 has some of the least engaging mechanics and gameplay. If you play this game, it will likely be Handsome Jack (as well as some of the other characters) that keeps you hooked. However, this is not to say that the gameplay on offer is not strong - much of what was on offer in BL1 is still here, but some of its novelty is lost, and I personally saw the removal of some of the more niche RPG mechanics (such as levelling up proficiencies with specific gun types) as a negative. Most people see BL2 as the best game in the franchise, and while I may not personally agree with this opinion, the game is still a great one that 100% deserves to stand alongside the other games in the series, especially due to its strong narrative.",8,XBOX 360
This is the greatest video game of all time. Handsome Jack is the greatest villain in video game history only rivaled by Vaas.,10,XBOX 360
"Good game. Various quests and good jokes. My only problem with this franchise overall is that characters only have one skill and your progression is only through guns and passives. I dont have any reason to replay the game with another class, because in the end, its just shoot with your weapon and sometimes use your ability.",6,XBOX 360
"Amazing game, every inch of this game is covered in bloody fun from beginning to end. The enemies and bosses combined with the loot grinding never gets old and feels so satisfying when you get an insanely fun drop that changes the way you do combat in the game. The loot in this game is ridiculously diverse and allows so much re-playability along with the six different and unique vault hunters you can use, not to mention being able to switch any weapon from one character to another you have. The story and characters are all done perfectly with a plethora of different takes from comedy to adventure to mystery to suspense to emotional loss to badassery and so much more. The unique world and all its designs give it a less dungeon feel and make it seem all most like an open world. Honestly this game has everything a looter shooter lover could ever want, it sits at number 2 on my list for best games ever played.",10,XBOX 360
"It was an amazing improvement from the first part! Also, all the DLC were totally worth it, amazing main and side stories. I really enjoyed hating Handsome Jack",8,XBOX 360
An improvement over the original. This is one of those bigger and better sequels. A must-play for fans of cooperative shooters. It ranks up with Dishonored and Far Cry 3 as one of 2009's best action games. I would rate Borderlands 2 with a 9 out of 10.,9,XBOX 360
"Everything the first one had to offer but better! Great story with one of the protagonist (the character I actually chose in part 1), being the leader now.",9,XBOX 360
"In 2009, Borderlands was released, which no one was waiting for.Firstly, they were waiting for a completely different, visually game, secondly when they found out that the game would be with “drawn” graphics all completely lost interest in it.But when the game came out, I went through it just binge.A fun, original, fantastic greenhouse with an incredible mass of weapons.Of course, Borderlands 2 was waiting for, but.In 2012, Borderlands 2 came out and brutally disappointed me.Although they say that the game must be held in the coopeous, I played alone.Since I didn’t succeed in finding sensible partners at that time, and playing an Internet with stupid, unfamiliar youngsters running away from you without demand or even leaving the session in the midst of the battle, well, this is still a pleasure.The game has become more complicated.But not gameplay, but simply enemies became more thick -skinned.Therefore, you have to go 5 times the same mission to raise the level and apply at least some visible damage to your enemies in the next mission.Therefore, it seems just a crime by an incredibly small number of additional missions that could be used for grind.This difficulty begins to be very felt somewhere in the second half of the game.I did not notice the visually special differences with the original, at least at the Xbox 360. Gameplain is all the same game of 2009.With small changes.These are also the same enemies throughout the game, just with different numbers above the head.For me, the differences are only in the plot.In general, the differences between the original and the sequel reminded me of these in Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. There are many on the paper, but to see visually a magnifying glass.And so summarize.The game is purely prohibited for solitary passage.Pleasure can only be obtained in a coop, if you pick it up!",5,XBOX 360
"This game is way better than the first borderlands, It funnier, smother, and looks **** awesome this is easily one of my newest Favorite games of all time, defiantly worth buying ^wrote this in 2012^ I love Borderlands 2. It's just incredibly fun. When purchased borderlands 2 I would have been playing hours and hours of Halo 3 and Reach with my childhood friend. We then started just playing this for hours and hours. Going through every quest, playing through all the side quests. WE WOULD SPEND HOURS in this game world. Getting to love the characters, the setting. I really need to go back after finishing Borderlands 3 and just enjoy the game again. Been way too long.",10,XBOX 360
"aside from the last single player dlc that released for this game it is the only thing saving the game from absolute mediocrity. the humor can be compared to that unfunny friend who thinks they are the wittiest person in the room rather they are merely being tolerated because their circle of friends is much too kind and they are not honest enough to tell them that their jokes are not funny and their presence is intolerable and awkward. the gore is also a sever downgrade from the first one, e.g there is just no crunch when you perforate the various unfriendly denizens of Pandora, it just does not have the same punch the first borderlands did. also the kooky characters that were added were not funny and only ever cringe worthy in the worst possible way, e.g tiny Tina the quirkiest , quirkster of quirksville also Antony birch is a poor writer. just to back up my review i have played all dlc as well as playing through the game twice as well as playing the (supposedly deemed PC master race version that adds nothing of value)",7,XBOX 360
"This is probably the best Borderlands so far, I vae completed this game like 5 times, it is just too fun",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is my favorite game of all time. I love absolutely everything about it, even all the bugs.",10,XBOX 360
"This is one of the best games i have ever played. They still support it, and the first year we got 4 great DLC Expansions followed by the 2nd year getting 4 more DLC Expansions even though they were much shorter. They also had 2 level upgrades and the 2nd one allowed you to run the gauntlet to unlock OP8 which made it ever funner. 10.0 without a doubt and i hope Borderlands 3 will be even better. The only negative thing to this game is if your after certain things farming can be a quick or long process depending on what your exactly after, but with 6 character classes and 4 player coop its still one of my favorites to date.",10,XBOX 360
"A huge improvement on the already amazing first game. The story is amazing, the gameplay is dare I say perfect, the animation and graphics are great. There's more bosses, more guns, more places and tons of more content in general. The game is fun, exciting and hilarious. What more could you ask for. Rating - 98%",10,XBOX 360
"Role Shooter Role in the first person, Good History, Ultracharismatic characters with the graphics in Cel Shading that permeates everything from an air to comic that feels great, many many weapons, vehicles, you will leave your ass of laughter playing it.",9,XBOX 360
"This is one of my best video games of all time. It like a upgraded version of the first game but way better. We can unlock skins, not take fall damage, you can move when you're down, get stronger weapons, and the map to this game is much better than the first. You have this cool memorable villain and recognize characters from the previous game and it's basically gun porn of video games. This game actually feels like a true Action Adventure Open World FPS role-playing game.",9,XBOX 360
Simply attractive game! looking at my playing hours so far could tell its awesomeness! graphic : 8 sound : 8 story : 7 (crazy and silly) gameplay : 10 ( its an endless fun),10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 does EVERYTHING better than its predecessor!! The game itself is a post apocalyptic/space western RPG game blended with a FPS shooter. Honestly, if you like games like Diablo and Call of Duty, you'll REALLY enjoy this game. Best of all, its funny, flashy and best of all, has LOTS of guns!! It's main feature is the campaign and doesn't have competitive multiplayer, BUT it does have 4 player co-op which gets more difficult and rewarding when you have more players in your team. (max 4) Along with it's DLC, this game will last you a good month with regular game play. (Possibly more with multiple playthroughs) There are 4 different UNIQUE and two optional DLC ones. Each with their own powers, skill tree, personalities and play-style. It's only drawbacks is traveling when you first start and moving to fast travel locations. On-foot movement is sluggish and make the game boring when you've revisited or explored an area mutliple times. Also, a few of the quests can get repetitive, but getting loot makes it rewarding enough to balance the repetition. OVERALL: Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game and blends a lot of good ideas in an entertaining experience single player or with friends!!",9,XBOX 360
"This game surely under the same Zeus to program it, hilarious, difficult, with a very well worked cell, funny secondary missions of doing, with an abundant content and by God a quite competent DLC, of ​​the few that are worth what they cost!",10,XBOX 360
"The first question people will likely ask is, ""Does this game live up to BL1 and DLC?"" and that answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" The second question, ""Is it better than BL1?"" and the answer is ""**** the most part."" So what's improved? Better gun mechanics (sound and feel), more humor, more frequent boss and sub-boss battles, easier to get a co-op game going and see who's online playing, character skill trees are improved, friends can select quests in co-op games rather than having to tell the ""party leader"" to do it, the new enemies are well designed, you can now dismember baddies, you can now tag items in your inventory as ""trash"" or ""favorite"" so you remember what to sell next time at the vending machine, you can now directly trade with people, you automatically pick up money and ammo (but thankfully not loot) and combat is more organic (enemies take cover, flank you, dodge attacks). So what's the negatives? The new menus are clunky and difficult to parse, missions still consist of mostly ""shoot that"" or ""find this,"" driving mechanics are about the same (though thankfully you don't take damage from hitting enemies as much), level design can be really confusing at times even with the new HUD mini map and sometimes there's simply too much dialogue happening simultaneously. For example if you're playing co-op the first big town you get to is a total cluster as multiple characters are introducing themselves cutting off the others dialogue. I find myself saying, ""what is going on?"" much more regularly during this game than BL1. That said, these are only minor complaints and the additions far outweigh the handful of small issues. In short, if you loved the first BL stop reading this review and go pick up the sequel!.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a game like no other. I am possibly the biggest fan of customization within a game that has ever lived and this game offers just that. From the millions of different weapons to skill trees to Badass Points and more, this game allows you to play the way YOU want to play. Along with the amazing amount of variety in player customization, there is also a tremendous amount of variety in the enemies and settings you encounter. The landscapes are beautifully done and the amount of places you travel is simply astonishing. I have played through this game 3 times so far and still love every minute of it. I have yet to find a game (besides Borderlands 1) that can compare. If you enjoyed playing Borderlands 1 or are simply looking for a game that offers endless amounts of replay value derived from its sensational amount of customization (or if you love loot!!!), look no further. TRY THIS GAME. :)",10,XBOX 360
"It takes long time and many shots to kill enemy, sometimes forever. I have to go back to place I went. I get lost. I sometimes don't know what to do. I hate the annoying animals. Horrible game.",0,XBOX 360
"Incredibly fun game, and one of my favorites. A huge improvement over the first game, **** one. Some of the most satisfying gunplay in any first person shooter, and the variety of the randomized guns that you can find dropped by enemies, in vending machines, chests, and random piles of rubbish gives the game an addictive quality. The writing is great (although, admittedly, the humor can be sort of hit-and-miss at times) and the presentation is very slick looking, offering a more pleasing aesthetic than its predecessor while maintaining the same general look. Tons of fun both single-player and co-op.",9,XBOX 360
"Diablo with guns, but not with the randomly generated environments. Unlimited loot and the guns are just awesome. It's great to find that ONE gun that's just perfect. This is a must play with all the DLCs. With split screen is a must play",8,XBOX 360
"THIS GAME ROCKS. This is my favorite game to date. The environments had a lot of replayability, the boss battles were memorable, and the loot was 2nd to none. Played this game and all of its DLC. The DLC overall was good, but the 2nd DLC was lacking. My only complaint is that more people do not own this game, so there aren't as many match making lobbies as there should be.",10,XBOX 360
"What isn't to like about this game? Lots of areas to explore, infinite gun possibilities, great A.I., and awesome 4 player coop. The graphics on Xbox 360 look pretty good and the frame-rate seems stable.",10,XBOX 360
I don't know how this game got so popular i just started and i keep dieing nonstop to level 3 enemy's. So far it is very frustrating. no way to change difficulty in game probably have to start a new one or hack the game.,2,XBOX 360
"While Borderlands may been known for it's wacky (and brilliant) world, Borderland's 2 also does shooting and Role Playing so well that it feels like a true adventure.",10,XBOX 360
"This is how every sequel should be. 2009's Borderlands proved that originality isn't dead just yet by splicing two videogaming staples together, the RPG and the FPS. The end result was an absorbing adventure which especially shone in co-op with friends. Borderlands 2 quite simply ditches everything from the first game that didn't work while retaining everything that did and cranking it up to 61. How do I love Borderlands 2? Let me count the ways. Firstly, apart obviously from its predecessor, the game is unlike anything else out there. It blows my mind that no other company has even attempted to rip off the Borderlands formula in the past four years. Next, looting. I love to collect loot. I'm obsessive compulsive about finding a gun with a tenth of a second faster reload time, or with 1 extra bullet in the clip, or a shield with a couple of thousand extra damage in its nova, or a class mod with slightly quicker health regen. Only in special games would you care about such things, but Borderlands 2 makes you care. In this respect the game shares much in common with #9 on my list. Every time I levelled up I was rushing to the skill trees to see what exciting new unique abilities I could upgrade my character with. The depth of customisation by the end-game is immense, with the right investments you can really configure some staggeringly powerful builds. The game is still being strongly-supported with new characters and campaign DLCs almost a year after its release, with more recently announced to be incoming. But one element really steals the show - the characters. Seen through the eyes of a brand new batch of vault hunters, the playable cast of the first game, who feature in the second as NPCs, take on an elevated sense of majesty. Claptrap is back and is as tragic and loveable as ever. In addition, Scooter, Moxxi, Dr. Zed and crew are joined by a host of other new Pandora residents, the writing for most of whom is stellar. Tiny Tina just makes the entire game. The icing on the cake is one of the best bad guys to grace the medium - Handsome Jack, equal parts stand-up comedian and evil genius. You will love him one minute and hate him the next, you will laugh and you will cry. It's wonderful to experience the whole thing online with your friends, coming up with strategies to survive some of the trickier situations (especially on Ultimate Vault Hunter mode), sharing out loot depending on which class everyone is playing, and just enjoying the unfolding story together. We danced and ate pizza with Claptrap. We played chicken in Ellie's car crusher. We hunted rare varkids in the Caustic Caverns and we helped Tina get revenge on Fleshstick. Best tea party ever.",10,XBOX 360
"A mix between a role playing game and a first person shooter. How could that turn out? Fortunately, it turned out pretty awesome. I haven't played the first game but I know about it's ending. The game starts with the vault from the first game containing an element called eridium in it, and an evil bad guy organization called the Hyperion corporation is using the eridium to advance technology and tame the savage alien world known as Pandora. The leader handsome jack wants to find a vault that has an unknown power in it called the warrior. Four new vault hunters come to Pandora on a train looking for the same vault, but handsome jack leaves a surprise for them and blows up the train. The vault hunters are lead to safety by a female AI known as angel and a robot known as Claptrap. They join a resistance group and try to stop Handsome jack and get to the vault first. There are some very unexpected twists and most of the characters are memorable. Handsome jack is a very **** villain, and I like that because most video game villains these days have no personality. And claptrap is hilarious and my all time favorite robot now. (Sorry r2-d2) The gameplay is superb. At the beginning you choose one of the four vault hunters as your character. There's the commando, siren, gunzerker, and assassin. Each one has their own unique abilities and skill trees to upgrade. You have the world of pandora to explore, and fast travel anywhere in it. It's very diverse, there's a snowy place, desert, acid caves, mountains, a city, and a it's absolutely huge and you can drive around it also. There are story missions and side missions, and you'll need to do missions to level up your character, because the enemies get pretty tough. There really are a gazillion guns, and you will rarely come across the same gun twice. Some have elemental effects such as fire or electricity. The enemies range from measly little bandits to gigantic worms with tentacles. The enemies are challenging and have there own weaknesses. You also earn badass tokens for completing challenges, and badass tokens permanently upgrade stats such as maximum health or melee damage across all four characters. The graphics in this game are plain awesome, when standing atop a mountain or tower you can see so much of pandora around you. The cel shaded art style fits well with this game and makes it more colorful and fits along with the humorous tone. The sound is great, at times this cool futuristic action music play, and all the guns sound different and distinct. The voice acting is convincing, and there are a lot of funny moments and stupid jokes thrown in there to make you laugh. So, do you like RPGs? Then buy it. Like open world games? Buy it. First person shooters? BUY IT!!! This game exceeded my expectations and gave me more than what I asked for. My only real complaint is that it can be cheap sometimes and kill you out of knowhere. And navigation can be slightly annoying, but those are just nitpicks. For 20 bucks, your getting 200-250 hours worth of game time , so this is definitely something you should get.",9,XBOX 360
this is one of the best games of this generation uniuque conicept until destiny bascally stole its ideas funny characters like claptrap and borderlands 2 is one of the best and most uniuqe game of last gen,10,XBOX 360
"Loot gathering gone even more insane, Borderlands 2 adds way more variety to the shields, grenades, class mods, and elements. The storyline has been greatly improved and the skill trees are even more mental. I loved playing through the game, the first time. 2K has unfortunately ruined this games second play through (True Vault hunter mode) if you are choosing to go it alone. The difficulty ramp up is manageable in the general areas, but the boss fights are no longer any sort of fun. 2K, this game has lost the replay-ability that made the first one of my favourite games. In spite of all the upgrades, this franchise has taken a step back for me. A great game that if you have lots of friends who can play, enjoy. If you like to go it alone, not quite as good as the first.",8,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game to play with friends. Collecting loot is as fun as ever, and the story is hilarious the whole time. It is just as good, if not better, than it's predecessor.",9,XBOX 360
"I was having fun for the first two levels then after that, the enemies started to become WAY TO OP!!!! I spent two hours trying to save the bird for a claptrap upgrade. I get spawn killed every time, I can't believe that I wasted $20 on crap that boring. The weapons were ok but way to weak. The is the most unbalanced game I've ever played, It's so stupid how I face level 20s while still a 15. It sounds little but it is a HUGE gap! It should be that the enemies are THE EXACT level as you for a good balance. This game deserves more than 0 but it's made by 2k which they are corrupted. The only thing I find entertaining out of this game is jack.",0,XBOX 360
I've sunk around 800 hours over 2 years into BL2. I just finished off all of the dlc and have finally had my fill. This is a game designed to be replayed over and over and provides so much gameplay/shooting for the price it.,9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a game that will make you laugh while you enjoy exploring the world around you. I play the game again and again and I always find something new or funny that i didn't find before. Also has one of the best villains that you love to hate in a long time. The only reason Borderlands 2 gets a 9 and not a 10 is because when in multiplayer the loot is not separate to each player but shared making getting one of the BAZILLION new guns hard when not playing with a friend. Never the less, this is a great game I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun enjoyable time.",9,XBOX 360
"This game will always be my favorite because of how good the 4 player co-op is. If you want a game were you can sit back have a couple of laughs and play with some friends this is the perfect game. The characters, witty dialog, map, guns, loot, and gameplay are just some of the things that make this game great. It takes everything from the original and makes it better like all sequels should and it make you want to play more. The best way to experience this game is with some friends. Definitely the best game to come out in 2012 and i cant wait for borderlands the pre-sequel .",10,XBOX 360
"This game is great !! first one was good and it's just better !! exploration, missions, fu**** sick guns, insane shooting action, cool graphics, funny characters, etc. buy it if you dont have it can't wait for the next one",9,XBOX 360
"I have put almost 300 hours into this game. It is really one of the most re-playable experiences I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The story is much better than the first, and the characters seem much more relatable and ""real"". On top of that, the game is hilarious. All the classes serve a specific role and are mostly pretty balanced and fun to play. However, there are a few minor annoyances that prevent the game from a perfect score. However, there have always been a few problems with this game that stem directly from the gameplay. First of all, about 15-20% of the weapons are completely useless. Not even considering rarity. All of the shotguns **** except for legendaries and one type that improves accuracy as you shoot (like Moxxi's Heartbreaker). 99% of the needle guns are useless. The sledge ball guns are awful. Meanwhile, find a plasma caster of the same level and rarity, and you can literally **** everything with little to no effort. The weapons are horribly unbalanced sometimes. The Ultimate Vault Hunter mode is also annoying to play. It isn't hard as much as it feels cheap. You can get downed, barely get a revival off of a nearby enemy, but only to get taken down to 5% of your health immediately and go down again. It is very frustrating and really only feels cheap instead of challenging. I have always felt that the second-wind system could be improved much more than it is. (Also, waiting a full half minute to respawn compared to the original is annoying) The baddass rank system **** as well. It basically maxes out at +10% to all your stats, which requires at least a couple hundred hours of playing. 10% to all your stats isn't really anything. Turning it off is honestly negligible. The old weapon proficiency system was much better and rewarding. The game has a low framerate too, in places such as Murderlin's temple I would go below twenties. That is shameful on a 360. And not being able to redeem gold keys without xbox live gold? That's **** stupid. Regardless, the game is awesome and everyone who likes shooters and RPG's should play this one.",9,XBOX 360
Just became a memeber and just want to say borderlands 2 goty year edition Is awsome and amazing having so much fun playing with family and friends If you havent played it what you watin for enjoy,10,XBOX 360
"BL is hands down my all time favorite series (I love the cel-shaded visual style and the mashing of FPS+RPG). BL2's storyline is much more engaging than **** second installment has even more humor than the first, with more quirky characters. I'm playing as Maya, the siren. The skill trees in BL2 have more to choose from than BL1 and they even added skin/head color/style choices for your character. The maps for different areas of Pandora spread out more than BL1, so there are even more creatures and bandits to score loot from. The side missions are just as humorous and aid in gaining experience. Without the side missions, it gets a little tough to run through the main story line as a single player. Luckily my bf can easily join my game and help me out if I don't feel like spending some time leveling up with side missions. I haven't completed the entire game with Maya, but I do plan to play all 4 main characters. That's how awesome this game is. I can't get enough.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 1, with better skills, better skill trees, more guns, and violence. This is the epitome of a the FPS RPG hybrid genre, For those Call of Duty players interested in this title, don't be expecting a fast trigger finger to be all you need. Plotting out your skills, your class mod, not to mention taking the right weapons into battle, all make the difference in what takes place. Plenty of side quests and DLC to keep you playing for days.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a strange game, unlike any others. The graphics, combat and voice acting are a beautiful combo. The graphics are the main feature that separates Borderlands 2 for others, they are cartoonish and it works so well. There is literally no end to the amount of guns in Borderlands 2, and most guns are elemental, meaning you can light your enemies on fire, melt them with corrosive damage, electrocute them, and so much more. The voice acting is probably the strangest thing, although there is no direct curse words in here, there are so many vulgar references, funny for adults and older teens, but probably not a good thing for youngins. Definitely a great game, no doubt.",9,XBOX 360
"First person shooter, levelling up system, bosses, classes, loot- Diablo with guns. Pros: Funny story. Imaginative. Great enimies. Great cell shaded graphics. Highly addictive. Fun multiplayer with SPLITSCREEN. Amazing levelling tree. Chaotic and fun. Challenging. Great length of about 40 hrs+. S*** load of guns, all unque, stats, stats, stats. Claptrap, and other characters are well voiced and written. Cons: Not really fun as single player, basically once you go to multi, being single seems boring. Vehicles needed more use.",9,XBOX 360
"If I where stuck in a room, with only one game to play forever, it would be Borderlands 2. After 18 months of playing this game, and still not tiring from it at all, I can easily say this is the best game ever made. Can wait to do it all again when it comes out on the PlayStation Vita.",10,XBOX 360
"Very fun to play with friends, and a cast of interesting characters to enjoy. but the gameplay feels very bland at times. One of the things I liked in the first Borderlands was the option to select a type of gun rather than just choosing the newest gun you have that has higher stats. I'd prefer rifles over sub machine guns so even if I found a subgun that was technically better than the rifles I would have, I'd still manage with a rifle instead. In ramping up everything, it feels like Gearbox tweaked the engine to the point that regardless of what the gun is, (sniper rifle, submachine gun, pistol) or who makes the gun, all of it becomes a mute point to the stats. This change made me feel like I was in an impossible spiral of downgrading my guns for technically better ones I didn't like to use. Even though they were better, statistically, they still felt like I had to consistently switch my loadout every level or so just to keep up with the exponential difficulty curve. The guns company brand and types became increasingly irrelevant with a slight exception to be made for elemental effect specialties. Another criticism I have, that is largely irrelevant to the target audience Borderlands 2 serves, is that you are basically just a tag-along as far as the story is concerned. Borderlands 2 isn't your story, it's the players' from the first Borderlands story. Old characters make a reappearance as NPCs, and once they arrive then you become little more than an assistant to their direction. The game doesn't make the player feel like they're the focus of the story, with characters talking more to each other and themselves than you or your party. All that said, the game is still fun to play with friends of a similar level. The strong focus on outright statistics in the game mechanics makes it very easy to balance and adjust for parties. Easy to recommended to fans of Borderlands and anyone who wants a colorful or different shooter to contrast with the realistic modern style FPS games out there, but not one to suggest to a friend who is looking for depth or someone not familiar with gaming in general.",5,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is an all around fun game. The loot is infinite! Not really but you get the point. there is so much loot. over all the game has an amazing story line with 4 play through's. The mobs have amazing and very fun commentary. And it adds a hole new feel to the game with coop mode. you can trade loot and money with other people, not to mention the risks of dueling Items. over all this is a spectacular game and i cant wait for Borderlands 3.",9,XBOX 360
"If you liked the first game, you'll surely like this second one. While the characters seem less thought-out than the first installment, they're still quite likable and interactive. Obscene remarks seem to have been turned down a notch? Which was a bit of a disappointment for me since I really liked the abrasive humor of the first game, but I got over that I guess. Everything is generally improved upon since the first game otherwise. Awesome DLCs. I met a few of the execs for this project during a party; really awesome people who worked their butts off to make this game what it is.",7,XBOX 360
"I loved this game, it had a great campaign and playing online was just amazing, the DLC is really good if you loved the campaign as much as I did and want to play more ! :) (I have played more than 3 days all up on it)",10,XBOX 360
"Here's why I don't **** this game's d*** like everyone else: 1. The game isn't really fun unless you have friends to play co-op with, otherwise you'll be left doing missions and gathering loot all by yourself. 2. Areas you've cleared will respawn them again seconds after you leave the region, making clearing them out pointless, except for the thrill of killing them to kill them yet again. 3. The cartoony graphics get old. 4. Using 100 different variations of basically the same gun gets very old. 5. The game revolves around getting loot. Pros: 1. It actually has a somewhat entertaining story. 2. The landscape is beautiful. 3. The guns look nice.",7,XBOX 360
"Very fun game. I was bursting out laughing for the first half hour. There is a clap-trap that follows you around and he is hilarious. The graphics are incredible and the world is full of life. I have only a few quarrels with this game: They did away with the amazing assault rifle from the first Borderlands and made them all do less damage and have less accuracy. Also, the sniping is much more difficult as the cross-hairs is very wobbly. The last one is that this game is pretty much made solely for co-op. It's not that you cannot enjoy this game on your own, but it is clearly intended to be play with another person. I had a great time playing with my friend but when he left (we're both married), it was difficult to continue on without him. My wife couldn't really get into the game either so I've been stuck in a limbo on playing it. Also, because the assault rifles aren't great and the sniping is annoying, it is hard for me to choose a character. It also seems like the character's special abilities are pretty lame compared to the previous characters (I really miss Mordecai's Bloodwing). But this is still a great game and I plan on convincing my wife to give it another try! One last thing, if you have played the previous Borderlands, there are tons of jokes in this one for you. Enjoy!",9,XBOX 360
"Improves in every way possible over the first, but for some reason I didn't like it as much. Maybe it just felt too familiar? I'm not entirely sure, but I think it was just too much. I still enjoyed it a lot though, just not as much. Borderlands 2 gets an 8.4/10",8,XBOX 360
"A slow moving story, underpowered weapons, terrible split screen co-op, and unbalanced combat seals the nail in the coffin for this poorly executed video game.",3,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a shameless loot grind. Sorry... let me rephrase that. Borderlands 2 is an extremely fun shameless loot grind, with great humor, wonderful cooperative play, tons of exploration, and wall sphincters.",9,XBOX 360
"Uber,Superb, Addicting, Brutal and Flashy. Who doesn't want to see hostile midgets that run after you with their axes get shredded in damage of fire and explosives? What about giant behemoth super badasses smashing down on your last percentage of health and in that brink of the moment you have to survive and switch out to your rocket launcher that shoots like 20 missiles of shock bolts? What about duel wielding two automatic explosive elemental snipers that makes you feel like a raining wave of destructive only to be met with the same force of agression by the smart ****? This game is a must have for the addictive nature of its FPS smoothness. IT FEELS GREAT KILLING THE CHALLENGES OF PANDORA. But that's the thing. Borderlands 2 CHALLENGES you to play smart or rage quit and try again at the first and second playthrough of the game. Some of the bosses are just brain melting that I needed to take a rest from because I wanted to beat them so bad but I couldn't because most of the times it is just unfair because you don't have the right weapons or there are just damage insta killers that are frustratingly hard to avoid. SO just take your time, pull out some of your hair from your scalp. respawn and try again The humor is flat out funny and constant throughout the game with the special uber characters that give you awesomely well down side-quest. It doesn't feel like a chore anymorike in the first borderlands. Side-quest are a thing that makes you want to play the game even more. Most of the side-quest are even leads to the hundreds of well down easter eggs. THe dialog is priceless and fits into the game and story-line perfectly like children and candy. The villian. Handsome Jack is probably the best or even the most epic bastard villians in my gaming experiences. You just want to straggle him until his eyes pop out because his the evil done so well that messes with you so very damn good. Example? I think his like the GLaDOS (Portal series) of Borderlands 2. Always teasing you and joking at you while you try to survive the thousands of enemies and wild lide tht he casually sends at your friends and you. THe story is very well done and emotionally driven towards the end game even with all of the silliness, it's very serious. So grab a couple of friends and play this majestic game together in divine perfection.. Though it could of been better.",10,XBOX 360
The game is improved greatly from its predecessor. The collecting loot is addicting and the multiplayer is very fun. This game is a must have for coop buddies or couples. 9/10,9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2, how do I put it, it was okay. I never really got into playing it mainly because, I did not expect it to be cartoon based, the in game tutorials went on too long, I absolutely hated the Scags, and I did not find the multiplayer very enjoyable. I probably wont buy another game from the Borderlands series.",6,XBOX 360
"borderlands 2 is tonnes and tonnes of content millions of guns, millions of shields and areas and enemies. There are 4 unique characters out of the box and 2 more available via DLC that provides a different and exciting way to play through the campaign. The DLC of the game adds even more content to an already 60-70 plus hour game. The shooting is much tighter than the first game and the graphics are greatly improved over the first game to make the environments and the enemies a treat to look at. the weapons are the star of the show however and there is always a new gun to use or a new shield to equip. the loot is handled well and the game also plays brilliantly with co-op. the story is not something the game is known for but i did enjoy the narrative of the game and handsome jack was a great villain. this game is one of the best of the generation in my opinion for a fun based co-op shooter with plenty of content, great shooting, tonnes of loot and a funny cast of characters.",9,XBOX 360
Compared to the first borderlands this game is a bad joke. The leveling of the weapons is so broken now that it is not funny..... A 500% damage increase on weapons from lvl 30-40 means you are constantly changing them out not because you want to but because you have to...... The way they limited the most desirable weapon mods to Legendary super rare was equally annoying..... It was also a lot buggier than the first one. Overall the game is a piece of garbage not worth playing. It is also building for a Borderlands online......,1,XBOX 360
"A unique take on the FPS, it greatly improves upon it's predecessor with tons of gut/ns, glory, and EXPLOSIONS! Tons of low-brow humor and fun to be had here.",9,XBOX 360
"I was skeptical at first,but when I got into it i was so Astonished.This game is one of the best Comic type games,i love the 4 Co play that's a rare feature in split screen not many games do that they require connection or going on line well i don't do that,i'm more of a single player.This is a good game to [buy]",8,XBOX 360
"A game that plays on being a complete badass and the fun aspect of modern fps games. With an interesting world to explore, fun and addictive gameplay. With very memorable characters and over 1 bajillion guns and easter eggs to keep you on your feet as a vault hunter.",9,XBOX 360
"Having been a fan of the 1st game and its DLC (save for Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot), I had high anticipations for the 2nd entry. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. The four new Vault Hunters (six if you include the 2 DLC characters) each have different abilities and skills, making each playthrough feel different. If there's one complaint I have with the first game, it's that the weapons all appear the same. Not in this game. Each of the 8 gun manufacturers have different shapes and designs for their guns, and the millions of guns in this game all look and feel different. You'll rarely see the same gun twice. Enemy variety is varied in the first Borderlands and even more so in this version, with a lot of returning enemies as well as several new varieties, each with different weaknesses and attacks. There's also an even wider variety of missions to undergo, everything from fetch quests to bizarre requests. But where this game really shines is in 4-player co-op. Like the first game, the game gets harder with more players, but hte loot enemies drop is much better. Everything is improved over the original, which was already a success. However, the DLC has been sub-par at best. But that hardly puts a dent in the overall enjoyment you'll get from this game. Any FPS or RPG fan will enjoy this game.",9,XBOX 360
"I got in late on the Borderlands series but i must say that Boderlands 2 is way better than borderlands 1 it has the Comedy, fun gameplay, good graphics, and a hella bunch of guns (which is what the game is known for). The enemies are fun to fight and loot is awesome to find. but the game also has a few boring points and annoying points that you just beg to get past especially in later playthroughs. right now i'm on my 9th playthrough and i still have fun playing through this game. I enjoy this and this is my go to game when i just wanna go and find a good time to play in.",9,XBOX 360
"I have played through this game about 1.5 times. It is an absolute masterpiece of gaming. Great characters, rewarding loot, and infinite weapon combos. Do not doubt buying this game. One of the best fps/RPGs of this generation.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 1 is the best in everything, setting, music, characters, humor, even the DLCs are more **** a single word would define it as: Boredlands 2_Saludos",7,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a step up from the original in every way, but there are technical issues and annoyances that keep it from becoming what it should be. The graphics this time around while similar in style, things are spiced up from the original by showcasing more variety in the environment and scope. The story this time around from the original's bare bones plot becomes one of the most hilarious and interesting ones this year thanks to solid writing an a witty villain. The gameplay is kept from the original but with improvements that make it better. However, the biggest annoyance is the framerate and the fact everything can happen at once. You will find moments where you are being pelted by bullet while listening to a log then a story log cuts in and starts playing all while your shields start bleeping and everything drops to low frames. It can be truly messy and annoying but that does not stop this game from being one of the best I've played in 2012.",8,XBOX 360
"I was a HUGE fan of the first game. In a review I would have given it 9.75 out of 10. And the bugs would have been the only thing keeping it from being a 10. This game is sub par. The gameplay can be fun at times, but there are regular enemies like Superbad Flame Threshers (i.e. NOT raid bosses) you fight in solo play that put you in FFYL in 1 hit and have more health than you can ever take, especially considering the FFYL timer is glitched and doesn't reset properly sometimes. I do like what they have done with character design. However having my inventory space cut in half is absolutely not fun at all. Inventory dumping every 5 minutes is terrible and repetitive. There is no ammo regen and the ammo capacities were lowered, making many ammo-hog guns worthless. The guns are kindergarten mockeries of what they were in the original, and several have been glitched to where they don't drop or are completely useless. (Cowboy Cannon) This is a level and loot game, and while they got the leveling right, the loot ruins it. And while everyone seems to rave about the story I have no Idea why. It's longer, not better. I love comedy when it is done right. I am a huge fan of Adult Swim and South Park. They are low-brow but brilliant and funny. This game is not. It tries constantly to be and usually fails. And the story is like some cheap pro-wrestling plot with the villain sneaking up from behind and getting away with dirty cheap tactics all the way till the end. Don't waste money on this sub par game. Go get the original if you haven't played it. If you have, wait till this one drops to the bargain bin. I'm very disappointed in Gearbox. I expected better.",5,XBOX 360
Great game. Very fun. Very funny and im glad i tried it. They made this game very well. I cant think of any problem other than the loot being the kind that only spawns once so whoever gets it gets it and no one else (for the guns anyway). Other than that its all good.,9,XBOX 360
"I really liked the first borderlands (maybe more). had been excited ever since hearing about the release of borderlands 2. defiantly not let down, if you like borderlands you will more than likely love this one also. the only reason I gave it a 7 instead of 10 is because playing solo is VERY hard. the creators have admitted its meant to be played as a team..I like playing alone. If you are playing alone you will have to get used to responding and losing a lot of money. I played the first one multiple times with multiple characters and rarely died so I don't believe its me. overall would recommend it but just want people to know it will probably be better if you have friends that are willing to play a lot with you.",7,XBOX 360
"If I had to judge Borderlands 2 after buying full price (59$ at release) I'd given it a heartfelt kick up it a** for being yet another game masquerading minor updates and added storyline as a sequel... Had it been a movie, a book, a whatever, then sequel would be a fitting title, but as gamers we demand substantial change when someone asks for a lot of cash from us who loved the first game... So, I bought it for $5, and that's what it's worth (if you've played the first)....nothing New...",5,XBOX 360
"In my humble opinion, Borderlands 2 is the best game in this console generation and perhaps ever made. Imagine a game that combines the replayability, and addictiveness of Diablo, with its loot drops and RPG elements, with the gameplay of a Call of Duty game. Pure genius! This game is amazing and the DLCs are superb. If you have not played either games, do yourself a favour and pick up Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition, which features all 4 DLCs and is packed with hours upon hours upon hours upon hours of great gaming fun. Then, after you have levelled all 4 characters up to 61, you can pick up B2. If you love shooters and are a **** for loot drops and RPGing, Borderlands 2 will not disappoint. Does anything even come close? Only Borderlands 1.",10,XBOX 360
"Boring shooter, the only difference from this and an FPS is this map is way bigger and more repetitive. I played this with a friend and it was hard to get through it because it was so boring. The weapons are in no way ""cool"" or entertaining. The story is the enemies are absurd and the bosses are even more so. You could defiantly skip out on this one",3,XBOX 360
"Truly great experience the characters were funny the story was great the game is addicting. I played through the story many times and it never gets old, and I will continue to play it through out the summer until GTA 5 comes out.",10,XBOX 360
"This game improves on the original perfectly, and is just a superb and superior game. It's got all the elements. Very engaging, multiplayer co-op is awesome, graphics, sound, story, first person shooting with RPG maneuverability, open world convergence and a loot and upgrade system across character classes just being epic. The game has it all, just wished my kids were old enough to play such an encompassing game but for adults, it's just fun and chock full. The game inclusions are second to none, a real delight and best overall game I have played on the XBox with every single incorporation. I hope they make a Borderlands 3 on the new XBox One. Such a good game that could be even more creatively added to with more compute power of the newer Xbox One platform. I look forward in wait and anticipation of an even mega Borderlands in the future.",10,XBOX 360
Considering duke nukem was garbage; I am not really surprised how bad this game is. Same as the first one. Just new characters and maps. The second and third playthroughs are trash. Randy Pitchford ruined this game. The eneimes are overpowered and the guns are underpowered. Most of the glitches that made this game good are gone. Now one bullet kills you and you lose all of your money. This was just a huge disappointment.,0,XBOX 360
"This is a super fun and funny game to play by yourself or especially with your friends the endless loot and humour of this game will keep you comming back for more. It plays much like the first with a few tweaks and an actual story behind the mayhem, great game!",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a beautiful, content-filled game, with plenty of intelligent design decisions, interesting characters, and a lot of variety. I normally don't like RPGs (Skyrim included) due to their extreme complexity and overwhelming amount of stuff. Borderlands 2, however, somehow manages to be just as complex without ever being overwhelming. And of course, the game is just plain FUN. You can tell that the developers put a lot of thought and care into the making of the game. (Disclaimer: I have never played the original Borderlands, so I can't compare the two games. Also, keep in mind, everybody will have a different experience depending on who they play with. Online play with randoms seems disastrous and solo play feels lonely and limited. I played through the game in offline splitscreen mode with a buddy. We only played with each other and neither of us ever played without the other. I do believe this was the best way to experience the game.)",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a huge success. I didn't play the first one but heard and saw enough of the second one for me to be interested. I have to say, I thought it was a great game. Of course no game is perfect and it has its blemishes, like this game. But overall you play a incredibly well produced balanced game with a huge amount of depth.",8,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 has a lot of great qualities that make it a great game. It's just disappointing that the small things end up hurting it. The main story takes 15 to 20 hours to beat and you MAY want to replay it. The use of the word may is highlighted, because I didn't feel propelled to take another run through the game. The True Vault Hunter mode basically bumps up the difficulty and left a lot to be desired to the point that I just got bored and quit. The randomly generated weapons are seriously cool, but tend to lack character and personality, making a lot of the firearms you'll utilize forgettable. The multiple playthroughs don't feel satisfying and only provides a slightly harder challenge. In the technical department, the game suffers from seriously ugly texture pop-up, probably at the fault of the Unreal Engine. The sound isn't very much to marvel at and the voice acting is pretty inconsistent. The script is pretty well done and I laughed a ton at the ironic humor that they throw in there. The memes and pop culture references are pretty unnecessary though and will probably make the game feel less timeless in the future. The reason I am giving this game a 7 is because of the randomly generated weapons and the humor. It's not to mention that the game is just a joy to play through a couple times, if you feel obligated to.",7,XBOX 360
"I liked the first game, liked the art design, the humor and gun playing. this game improved from the first one, especially the story-line, which was a joke in the first game. it is also much fun to play co-op with a friend online. however, i just cannot put as much time as i did in the first game, too repetitive overall.",7,XBOX 360
"This game is great! The graphic are unique and the gameplay is awesome! With over one bajillion different guns, you will never get bored of the loot you will get. There are many interesting characters and the quests are fun and interesting. The co-op is flawless with the ability to take on harder challenges with your friends. Although, the characters are basically the same as the original Borderlands characters with the exception of Salvador and Gaige. Also, there are lots of texture pop-ins which annoy me but it doesn't take away from the game. The story is interesting and I have to give 2K a big thumbs up for Handsome Jack as he is one of the most well scripted villains of 2012! There is also customization in this game with hats and skins for your suit. Overall, this game surpasses Borderlands and is one of the best 'shoot and loot' games of 2012.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is everything a great sequel should be; it takes the best aspects of the original and expands upon them, improves any weak points of the original and, makes sure that it does not feel like a repackaged version of the original. 2K Games and Gearbox have created a fantastic, unique and engaging FPS, with Handsome Jack being one of the best video game villains of the last few years. Do not presume this is just Borderlands 1.5, this is a great new visit to Pandora.",9,XBOX 360
"There is nothing negative about Borderlands 2. They expanded on everything that they needed to, and made little changes to everything that they needed to change to make it feel different from Borderlands one, which I invested an entire summer into, leveling my soldier to level 57. I feel like I'll be playing Borderlands 2 for much longer than I played one, and I have logged countless days into leveling my assassin since day one to where I am, as well as digging into other characters. I would give this game infinity/10 if I could, but I can't, so I'll give it 10/10. Live long Zero!!!!",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is little more than Borderlands 1 with new maps and a new story. Little innovation in a formula, that by itself was already unoriginal and somewhat boring. In Borderlands 1, about 2/3 of the game you would be getting tired of the combat, that is always the same from start to finish. Borderlands 2 is more of that. Only now the game is bigger so before you get halfway you will start having that feeling. The gameplay is always the same from start to finish and (surprise!) it gets tiring. Sure it has lots of guns, but can you really call them different? 5 different ""effects"" to add to weapons, mostly visual, and weapons that change the skins but do mostly the same. Not enough to keep me focused until the end. All in all, if you loved the first Borderlands, chances are you will like this one too.",6,XBOX 360
"This is one of my favorite games so be warned, I might be a bit biased. :) I honestly feel that of all my Xbox360 games (and I do have quite a few) this is the one that was the best ""investment"". As many have said before me, this is exactly what a sequel should be: bigger, better, smoother but still basically the same. I have never been disappointed in this game, every time I play it a smile appears on my face that won't go away until it's time to go to sleep (I do have to work, sadly). There is a ton of content in this game, the gunplay never gets old and the characters are different enough that you need to approach situations very differently depending which one you use. I just wish more of my friends would play it so we could do more co-op. Sadly, they are mostly BF3 fanatics.",10,XBOX 360
"I gave Borderlands 2 a lot of time, and it unfortunately fast becomes very boring. One of the reasons is the new co op mode. Playing with my limited number of friends online, who have already gotten very far in the game, I was given some level 50 equipment that was used to sell off. I bought so much good stuff and wreaked havoc through the storyline with my level 50 buddies, it then became a serious chore. That's unfortunate. Borderlands 1 was excellent, and was played entirely with a buddy of mine split screen co op. Borderlands 2 was exactly the same, and that's not cool, it's being charged twice for the same game.",4,XBOX 360
"This game makes my peepee hard. Great dialogue, possibly the best villain EVER, and tight controls. I'm not even a fan of FPS, but I loved every second of this game.",9,XBOX 360
"Compared to the first Borderlands not much has changed in this new instalment. It is a lot more story focused and it is easier to tell which gun belongs to which in game company but otherwise it's the same 4 guys running through the same scrapyards fighting the same mask wearing wierdos. If you really enjoyed the first I can recommend it as it's pretty much the same with a new paint job, but if you were waiting for a sequel that was bigger and better I'd give it a miss.",6,XBOX 360
"I loved the first borderlands and now I love the second one. I love collecting loot, especially gun loot that are randomly generated every time. I usually ignore the harder difficulties that some bosses posses and kill them so quick just to find the next awesome loot the perfectly suits my playing style. Yet, when playing in the awesome 4 player co-op, its not so awesome when loot inst shared between everyone! Lets just say, when a gun drops, the whole group will run to that gun and rapidly press X to get the gun first and this is extremely frustrating! Sort this out Gearbox! But, moving away from loot, the storyline is epic. Its hilarious, crazy and just overall amazing. Some lines that characters come out with too are incredible, especially Handsome Jack who persistently taunts you with funny one liners. Bosses and mini-bosses are great, they are all varied with wild names, like Flesh-stick. Some characters are dull, but those dull characters are removed from your skull because of the brilliantly designed characters found in the game, like CL4P-TR4P and Handsome Jack. The characters from the original borderlands also make a return which help you complete your quest to ultimate destiny! Overall, this game is amazing and is probably the best game of 2012, aside from Far Cry 3 of course! Melson97",10,XBOX 360
"Played the first Borderlands and found it somewhat enjoyable. Playing BL2 was more **** towards the end. The level tree was somewhat tedious, the weapons never really kept up with the levels that you made, and the skill points were pretty much useless. Just a drone ****, no replay value whatsoever.",4,XBOX 360
"One of the funnest games I've played in recent memory. The constant weapon/shield/class mod upgrades, BadAss points, skill tree and character outfit customization make this game very addicting. Online play is superb and very engaging. If you're looking for something to take over your life. This is the game. Highly recommend it.",9,XBOX 360
"Easily a 10/10, but with no real feel to travel fast kinda gets lame. Takes along time to level up after like level 3, best villain along with far cry 3, Vas. Love the look, great humor loads of guns, loads of explosives, and a good amount of environments. With a good co-op portion to the game making it harder to play and win. Not a variety of characters to play, or change of your own style. Game-play is a straight 10, fun same thing, maps lovely 10, story uneven 8 to 9. Guns he-he-he you know the drill. One thing the your not as bad-ass like in the first game overall. After a lot of playing though you'll get your self back to bad-ass.",9,XBOX 360
"A good sequel to the first Borderlands but i feel this game is Overrated to an extent. The new scenery was a nice change from Borderlands 1 and the game having a storyline was a definite plus. However the game got a bit repetitive too quickly, the skill-trees weren't up to much and for a game that prides itself on having a huge amount of guns i ended up with similar ones at most points of the game. Overall it was an enjoyable experience but one that good have been improved",7,XBOX 360
"As someone who put countless days into the original, nobody was more excited for this game than I. Borderlands 2, is without a shadow of doubt, a Masterpiece! The nonsensical story of the first game, has been twisted, molded, morphed, and in some areas beaten to work with the new one. Explaining every action taken in the original. The new characters added are unique in their abilities, and personalities. Speaking of characters many from the original return, and have only gotten better with age. New NPCs added fit right in with the desperate wasteland. The majority of the game is spent fighting the Hyperion Corporation from the first game, under their new CEO: Handsome Jack. Amazing writing, and acting make this villain one the best to ever touch a game. The loot system is back, and more varied then before. With each manufacturer having a unique perk to their weapons. The driving has been greatly improved, (Thank God) they even have a few driving missions. The humor in this game is top-notch, even dark humor after dramatic events (Though terrible) still gets a chuckle. Borderlands 2 is a game you can play for months, and not lose interest. Playing with friends in co-op only increase the experience, as enemies become tougher, and more varied with elemental attacks. If you're a fan of the original, buy this game. If you're a fan of shooters, buy this game. If you're a fan of loot, buy this game. If you're a fan of feeling like a badass, buy this game.",10,XBOX 360
"Overall, this game is a reboot of Borderlands 1 with some gameplay tweaks to make the game harder and the Vault Hunters more vulnerable. With its focus on being a ""badass,"" Borderlands 2 lost the charm that the original Borderlands had. Perhaps this is the way of catering to the next generation. The addition of Crawmerax-style bosses after the fight was nice. But the inclusion of hundreds of other vaults kind of **** the wind out of the game, and the DLCs so far haven't helped any.",8,XBOX 360
Fun game and a massive improvement to the original but some how it just got boring. I don't care about loot so much and grinding to get it is just ridiculous so I cheated tested out all the best and meh is all I can say. If you take the loot out this game suddenly becomes quite dull which is sad because loot shouldn't make a game special. On top of that they put out two DLC which each has the exact same running joke about the guy betraying you. I don't know the joke got old and although the game made me laugh I wouldn't have minded a few serious moments or truly epic moments at least to allow me to enjoy the comical moments more. A game that is a constant joke just isn't funny or fun in the end.,6,XBOX 360
"Not perfect, but better than the first Borderlands (DLC notwithstanding) Full Review Here ****/articles/game/item/65-borderlands2review",8,XBOX 360
"Hooked me in a way the first game never did, this game is fantastic by yourself and even more fun with friends. Plus it has the huge choice of weapons that all fans of the series are looking for. Here's to hoping that the rest of the series is more similar to this game than to the first.",9,XBOX 360
This game is so good awesome gameplay the co-op is so much fun and there is so much content me and my friend are trying to do everything we have like 75 hours and we still have like 70 missions left even the villain is good but the story is just ok but you dont play it for story but anyways get this game,9,XBOX 360
"If this game is a crowd pleaser then I suggest that the crowd has confused fun for addictiveness. The game is loaded with Skinner box techniques designed to keep you playing, but the gameplay itself is weak and poorly designed. The humor is mediocre and the plot is atrocious. This game is much cheaper now, so think about picking it up for 30 bucks, as I did. That price is much more in line with its actual quality.",6,XBOX 360
Although the game is better than the first one. I really couldn't get absorbed into the game-world enough to fully enjoy what it had to offer. This is why I will give the game a 7/10,7,XBOX 360
"In order to like it, you have to appreciate the comedic moments in it, and all the jokes that come with it. Overall, i loved playing it, and I believe that it is quite challenging to tackle alone. You will not get bored easily with that game, and you would want to play it over again more than one time. I do, however, wish that more people could join a game instead of a 4-player co-op. Or it could be like an MMORPG, where everyone would be in one huge server and roam the area with random people, possibly making friends in the process. Idk, it seems like a good idea...",7,XBOX 360
"On the surface not much seems to have changed since the original Borderlands. Play this sequel for any length of time however and it soon proves itself to be a superior game. Both the story and script are just that bit sharper and often genuinely funny, the skill system has been expanded (Including a new 'badass rank' which rewards the player with boosts to their stats for completing certain challenges) and there are fewer missions that are nothing but glorified fetch quests. All this and a host of other minor tweaks meant that, while I bored of the first title before seeing it to the end, there was never any danger of me stopping before I saw Borderlands 2 through to its finale. This is co-op gaming at its very best.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a game that gets just about everything right, including the two most important parts of an Action RPG, the Action and the RPG both of which are superb in this game. Unlike a lot of games where all the guns only serve as a means to kill the enemy, in Borderlands 2 each type of gun is significantly different to the others to give you reason to choose whether to use the pistol or the sniper, this becomes even more varied with the different weapon manufacturers which gives all the weapons in the game their own unique characteristics. The icing on this cake is the elemental damage a lot of weapons offer, which if used right can make an important difference when killing some of the tougher enemies. All of which is supplemented by the fact the actual game engine is on par with any of the dedicated FPS shooters out there including the current king Call of Duty. As good as all this is though, on it's own it would soon get boring, and that's where the RPG element comes in, not only do you have a variety of locations to explore, and some rather interesting characters to interact with but like any RPG a leveling system not only serves to improve your characters signature special power but also keeps the game challenging. You will find yourself facing tough enemies any time you enter a new area, really making you work for your kills and XP, but later on when you return to these area you will find yourself levels above the enemies allowing you the godlike satisfaction of mowing them down without breaking a sweat. As you continue through the game this up and down roller-coaster continues making sure the game gives you both a pretty decent challenge but also a whole lot of fun. So to recap, Borderlands 2 is an awesome game... but wait... it gets better. Unlike a lot of games where the downloadable content adds very little to the game other than to get more of your money into publisher hands, Borderlands 2 actually delivers DLC that is just as good as the main game, giving you reason to either break from the main story or return to the game. Perhaps the best bit of Borderlands 2, the developers haven't shoe-horned in Multiplayer modes into it, there is no Team Deathmatch or King of the Hill, no flags to capture or bases to hold, just you and up to 3 other people running round Pandora, shooting and looting and occasionally getting your butts handed to you buy some of the games harder bosses. This for me is the game of 2012.",10,XBOX 360
"Let me preface by saying I have played both BL1 and BL2 extensively and played through all available DLC as well. My review will consist of 10 positives and 10 negatives aspects of the game to establish what works and what doesn't. PROS: 1) Graphics are much improved over BL1. Also very little texture popping or rendering issues. 2) Environments are more varied and colorful. 3) Good plot with storytelling elements that really add to the game. 4) UI is much improved and easier to manage inventory and compare items on the fly. 5) Creative enemies and bosses with back-stories. 6) Good variety of characters to choose from, each with very different playstyles. 7) DLC thus far has been fairly solid. 8) Plenty of side-missions, easter eggs, collectibles, etc to keep players busy. 9) Addition of bank and secret stash system is very useful. 10) Generally more refined gameplay experience. CONS: 1) No health packs - really punishes players who play aggressively. 2) Gun upgrade system replacde by bad-ass tokens which are inferior. 3) Loot drops are EXTREMELY low for rare items. 4) Solo players are punished for playing solo. 5) New Second Wind system is not fun and repeated Second Winds mean almost instant death. 6) Gun and other loot feel lackluster. 7) Level scaling doesn't always make sense. Enemies 5 levels lower can sometimes wreck you. 8) ""Invincible"" bosses are frustrating and drop bad loot. 9) Game is too gun-centric. You will have a very hard time in the upper levels without the rarest guns. 10) Gearbox is patching things that made the game fun, and not fixing major problems like lost characters saves and lost bad-ass ranks. So all in all, as an avid player of both games, I would argue that well the game is pretty and the story good, they removed quite a few of the elements from BL1 that made the experience so enjoyable in the first place. I am not saying make the game easier, but the removal of the gun skills from BL1 was a big disappointment to me. I want my character to be a bad-ass that can be stealthy or destroy hordes of enemies. I don't want to be hiding and trying not to die every time I encounter a group of enemies. If I want the game to be hard, let me decide that. I hope maybe some of these things would be taken into consideration for future DLC or the inevitable BL3!",6,XBOX 360
"I absolutely loved this game. It took everything that worked from the first game and improved upon it. Great visuals, fun & interesting characters and a great story. But the real star here is Handsome Jack: Best video game villain , EVER! If I had one bad thing to say about the game, it would be that it was a bit weak that they didn't try to be a bit more original with the four starting characters. They're basically next gen variations of the four main characters from borderlands 1. But the Mechromancer did change that a bit. Overall won of my favorite games of all time and a must buy for anyone with a passion for gaming.",9,XBOX 360
"I don't know where to start with this review so I'll just start and keep it simple. Borderlands 2 is one of the finest games of the year, it appeals to so many sensitivities in the gamer in all of us. This is a must play for any shooter/rpg fan. One of 2012's must play games, heck one of this console generations must plays. I've played through twice one in tvh mode and now I'm in for a third. This game is addictive and has tons of replay value, plus more dlc and level cap increase are on the way. Play this game!!!",10,XBOX 360
"Everythig about this game says streamlined,professional,ingenious,witty, comical, hilarious, and of course, VIOLENT! I was skeptical starting this game, but now, i can't stop! it's rich storyline, nonsensical characters, intricate gameplay, and of course the millions of weapons available make this a gem to keep you enraptured for a long time.",10,XBOX 360
"I can't say enough good stuff about this game, but here are a few of the standout items. It's fun to play! The controls are tight, and it's easy to aim/shoot. If you like exploring every twist and turn of an area, looking for hidden goodies or collectibles, you will enjoy this! The colors are vibrant and the graphics are crisp. The missions are engaging and never seem like busy-work. There are a few fetch quests, etc. but they are rare and optional. You can skip side-quests if you want, and just concentrate on the story. Need to level up or at an area that's too tough for you? Jump in a public game, and play a bit with or go do a few side-missions to gain some XP and better guns. The character classes are varied so you should try them all to see which is your favorite. The skill trees make a big difference as well. Once I had enough skill points to fill our a whole tree, it made the character feel completely new! A neat feature is if you beat a ""boss"" you can revisit the area later, and the boss respawns, rewarding you with big time loot and XP every time you beat him. Not finding rare guns enough? Follow Gearbox on twitter or Facebook as they are giving out ""golden keys"" which you can use any time to get a level-appropriate rare weapon, shield, etc. Great game, fun to play!",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 was a amazing game witch is better than Borderlands 1 (BL1 was a great game). The characters are soo funny and by far Claptrap is the most epic out of all of them. Borderlands 2 has a story to it(BL 1 did not) and in Borderlands 2 the areas are different almost every time with look(another thing BL1 did not have). Playing Solo is great but this game was series is soo popular with the CO-OP experience, its better than ever! Handsome Jack the villian has to be the best vilian in a game by far, I mean I hate him, love him, think hes' halerouand so on. The only con to Borderlands 2 is how it kept freezing a lot and glitchs I had with it, but you guys might not be having the trouble. Borderlands is an a game you should buy nw as so as you read this review. Borderlands 2 9.2/10",9,XBOX 360
"TL;DR The better sequel to Borderlands 1, which still doesn't say much. To start, just know that there is nothing subtle about this game. The dialogue, ""humor"", anything, everything is basically in your face, for the good and bad. I'll explain that here... To start, the art, guns, gameplay, and characters (personality wise, at least) have definitely been improved over the first. However, the game is still a better version of 1 that didn't improve on much of the problems, rather, they've been seemingly masked. Firstly, there are not a bazillion more guns, there are simply more combos of pre-made guns (modding and making your own is still very fun and an option luckily). You WILL see the same guns more than twice. Second, the feel of the guns is definitely better, but combat is still the same old ""going in guns blazing with endless second winds"" or ""hide and pick them off one by one"". The action skills have been vastly improved at least, and are all useful. Third, I might start ranting here, but the story and the dialogue tied to it **** so good, to say the least. If you like toilet humor and jokes that are forced upon you, then maybe you'll enjoy it, however, don't expect any well thought out humor here. Granted, there are moments anyone can still laugh at, but the humor is still bottom of the barrel and mostly appeals to the demographic of 13 year old boys. The story is also very mediocre and riddled with (bullet) holes. Besides it being a complete reboot of the first (find the vault, oh no bad guys!) , it now has a primary antagonist that belittles and taunts you throughout the WHOLE game. Handsome Jack is simply another mediocre villain, unfortunately, and any potential he had was wasted on his loud-mouthed, arrogant character who taunts the hero nonstop, while never confronting them, quickly becoming a big joke. The characters also seem really odd. I don't know if you can relate to any of them at all. Like the humor and many, many pop culture references, they suffer from a bad case of ""OMG so random and funny!"". If I had to pick the biggest offender, it'd be Tiny Tina. Regardless, they all have the combined emotions of a sack of potatoes, and none of them really come off as memorable. Overall, BL2 is indeed the better successor to the first, but even then, the game is anything but a masterpiece.",7,XBOX 360
"I realize a 10 essentially means the ""perfect"" game, and while not perfect I have not had so much fun in a long time with a game. BL2 builds upon the successful aspect of the first game, and fixes much of what was lacking in the first. The classes all now feel more viable, guns are better, the humor is more frequent, it is a very well constructed game. It isn't just a copy paste like many games today.",10,XBOX 360
"I've been really astounded by how much the devs of this title have been able to blend shooter elements and RPG elements, overall making it an RPG. The idea is stunning and the game turns out to be stunning as well.",8,XBOX 360
"Just a few words, great enjoyment, gearbox really did do a good job on game play, but the story is ****. It has cool bosses, but they aren't exciting and the game is just not a big challenge, you just respawn where you die",8,XBOX 360
I have been playing this game at least three or four times a week since its release date and it has not yet failed to keep me entertained. The looting aspects and the high-octane gun fights keep me coming back for more. I rarely play without at least one more in my party and when you have a full four together it can be quite intense and satisfying. There are flaws (being able to have a four player brawl in Sanctuary would be amazing) but not enough so that it would keep me from playing. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys FPS and loot-based RPGs.,9,XBOX 360
"This game is absolutely amazing. It has a very nice graphics and a wonderful cell shading style to it. I like how many guns there are in the game. One thing that is a bit annoying, is that there is no head shots, only critical hits. But you can get over that. I would recommend this game greatly for anyone who were a fan of the previous game .",9,XBOX 360
"I didn't play the first one but that's okay because this game rules. That's a well spent 65 bucks right here. Fun, funny, enjoyable, thrilling and awe-inspiring. Yeah, man",10,XBOX 360
"A unique take on the FPS, it greatly improves upon it's predecessor with tons of gut/ns, glory, and EXPLOSIONS! Tons of low-brow humor and fun to be had here.",9,XBOX 360
"This game is truly an upgrade from the first, which was still by far a a gem. Its fluid game play, ""Biziliandy guns,"" and an incredibly memorable cast of characters and humor leaves just about nothing left to be desired. The DLC is also just as profound though quite shorter. If you love the loot mechanics and its FPS style and humor, don miss this game.",9,XBOX 360
"I liked this game, but not as much as the first even though this is vastly superior. The story and set up is intriguing right from the get go but as soon as you start you realize that its far far more linear. Its really just go do this, bring me that or kill me this many creatures for the first few hours. This isn't always a bad thing because you get a feel a for the game, the controls, the combat disciplines. The problems start with the difference with side quests and main quests. If you do all the quests you become way too powerful but if you only do main then be prepared to grind bullymongs for a while. Then more problems come with the scaling enemies, oh you like that beautiful piece of kit you just found? Well don't get too attached to it because its gonna be replaced by something twice as better to help you deal with the equal enemies. I know that you level up and gain access to more skills and perks but it really doesn't feel like its getting easier. Boss battles are another gripe, normally grinding beforehand lets you just smack them or hiding and exploiting cover allows you to just ping them down if you're lazy. Everything else is a plus though: the feel and aesthetics of the guns, the difference in companies, the locations, the stories of the characters and the graphics. Unfortunately this doesn't save this game for me from the infuriating mechanics of not feeling like your progressing in terms of strength, the constant replacing and cold detachment to your equipment and weapons and the easy for boss battles. Its good and its a lot of fun to play with friends online or splitscreen but all in all I'd rather play something where feel I feel a bit more connected with the games lore and universe .",7,XBOX 360
"Excellent game. Once again, we get the silly humor and funny characters that we all enjoy. The weapons are given extra types of stats to help build up the variety. The graphics and animations were given some nice improvements. The multiplayer is fun as hell. However, there are still some negatives. The performance was pretty bad for me, and I have a very high-end PC, but I was able to fix this by making a quick config file edit. There's also a lot of parts in the game where enemies are painfully spammed and you end up just mindlessly tossing grenades and spraying bullets until you have a chance of survival. Sometimes the enemy spawns get so repetitive that you might just dash back and forth to objectives without fighting because of the boredom of trying to kill every enemy around you. Otherwise, the game is something worthy enough where almost all types of gamers should play it without delay.",8,XBOX 360
"Gearbox software is a game developer that has really developed itself over the years. A few mediocre Half-Life expansions, to the infamous Duke Nukem series are a few of the odd titles Gearbox has churned out over its lifespan. Undoubtedly, Borderlands 2 stands out as the crown jewel of Gearbox's vault of games. After sinking about 5 days worth of playtime into this game, only a few minor complaints are what stand in the way of it being absolutely flawless. Borderlands is a mash-up of two distinct genres, FPS and RPG. The two are blended seamlessly thanks to some truly genius developing on Gearbox's part. Players start at level 1 and shoot/loot their way all the way up to level 50 through a rather hilarious adventure involving many different locations to quest across. Enemies require more thought and skill to take down than the original Borderlands, and it makes for a fun trip that rarely ever feels like it's just another RPG grind. Bosses are challenging but not impossible, and some enemy types are pretty cool. Another part of the experience is a loot system that randomly generates guns, shields, class mods, grenade mods, and relics that scale to the players particular level. Things like damage, fire rate, and recharge speed are all determined based on the level of the item looted. The difficulty and levels of enemies scale nicely to the campaign's pace as well, which is more challenging to make happen than you might think. Gearbox has really created a memorable world here as well. There are only a few characters that I wish had a skip dialogue button, lighting effects are magnificent, and the visuals are generally aesthetically pleasing. Some textures are ridiculously pixelated, but it doesn't really detract from the shootin' and lootin'. There are also many, many pop culture references such as Lord of the Rings and Minecraft just to name a few. On the negative side, the frame rate can be a pretty big issue. The game has a hard time keeping up (especially on the 360) during intense shootouts to downright freezing for a good couple seconds during a double conference call shotgun rampage. Also, prepare to see the ""fight for your life"" screen quite a bit. You can easily get back up by making a quick kill but you may get frustrated trying to run through enemies, or doing a quest you maybe aren't quite high enough level for. These complaints aside, Borderlands 2 is a game any fan of FPS games or RPG games should buy. I'm still having fun with it far after I hit the level cap on my Gunzerker. Well done Gearbox, well done.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a long tedious game, with cheap deaths, and gameplay that gets stale after the first twenty hours, and bad driving physics. The game is long, and tedious because leveling up takes forever. You have to get tons of experience to level up, and to add insult to injury you can't even buy skill points until you are level 10. Finding your way around the maps takes forever thanks to bad level design; you'll spend a lot of time wandering around aimlessly like a rate in a maze. Another thing which makes the game so long and boring is that the fast travel system is badly designed. There aren't enough teleport stations to help you get around quickly enough. I found myself on loooong trecks to teleport stations way too often. Once you level up to a certian point old lower level enemies reward you almost no exp, but they can still kill you quite easily. The result is trekking through annoying enemies in order to get to where you are going. The deaths in this game are very cheap, due to boss enemies being able to instakill you at times. You can die for trivial reasons such as accidentally wandering into a zone that the gamedesigners didn't want you to go. On the other hand you take no falling damage, and you can apparently walk on water. Dying doesn't have too many consequences other than respawning, being taunted by the game, and being forced to walk a long distance to restart the mission you were on. Dying to a boss that can instakill you with one or two mortar shots, and running back to fight that boss, over and over agian is boring as hell. The driving physics are just bad in this game. Expect to get caught on a rock or two, or just ram into a small tree and be forced to right yourself. The game has good points such as humor, and decent gunplay, but overall this is an annoying grindfest, full of dying over and over.",6,XBOX 360
"Take the original Borderlands, add direction and storyline. This is epic entertainment! Smart, funny and addictive. Tiny Tina alone makes it worth the fee! Take'em, Take'em, Take'em!",10,XBOX 360
"I played the first Borderlands which i really enjoyed. Borderlands 2 is a must have game in any gamers library. The group missions are awesome, challenging, and require team effort to complete. I have no complaints other than the matchmaking system can be improved, its a little difficult to navigate. For their first time implementing online multiplayer they sure did a great job. Like i said, no real complaints here for this must have game and a huge improvement over the first.",9,XBOX 360
"I feel that this game left a lot to be desired. When the game first started I found myself literally giggling at Jack every time he popped on the screen. That changed as the game took a very dramatic shift halfway through. I found it rather tedious to work through the story after that. The guns don't feel at all very powerful which is lame, because you spend a **** amount of time farming for some of them. And the game has been causing a lot of system freezing for a lot of people who dropped between 70 and 200 dollars on it. I am one of those people. Overall the game was a fair disappointment for me.",4,XBOX 360
"This game is fantastic in combat. brilliant with combat and absolutely astounding with the amount of weapons that are in the game-play. I love the fact that there is a character fit for any gamers combat style whether it be that your a stealthy fighter (Zer0), a defensive and tactical fighter (Axton), an extreme powerhouse (Salvador) or a supportive fighter (Maya). The DLC character is another great addition as Gaige is a deadly foe to have as in a second she can have her robot Death-trap obliterate you within a second. So it is with great honour that I give Borderlands 2 a 10/10.",10,XBOX 360
"It's an upgrade from BL1 plain a simple. What people don't seem to understand is that you don't play it once and that's it. It's meant to be played at least 2 times to reach max level and start play through 2.5. Your first time playing you might get to around level 35 or so before you beat the game. Your second play through starts True Vault Hunter Mode or TVHM. Everything is scaled in the beginning to your level and enemies are of course harder, you keep your weapons and gear from your previous play as well. Once you've beaten the game the second time that triggers play through 2.5, where pretty much everything is max level for that related monster or NPC and will drop the best possible level gear.",10,XBOX 360
borderlands 2 is **** gameplay is great theres a lot of missions and side quest.very funny i suprised for good becuase i dont like that kind of games i will give it 9/10,9,XBOX 360
"A step up from Borderlands 1. The humor was spot on and, overall, the game was great. On the negative side, they ruined the siren class with a nowhere-near-as-fun ability as Lilith had. Also, I found myself having dying a large amount of time due to fights being designed for 4 players.",8,XBOX 360
"Here's how this goes: put game in, start game up, hilarity ensues. Great game, very entertaining,but eventually repetitive. I can only start up the campaign and listen to Handsome Jack so many times. Still a solid 9.",9,XBOX 360
"BL2 trumps BL in every conceivable way. Better shooting mechanics, better AI, better writing, etc. Personally I love the Borderlands art style and humor, but I also get that the art and humor isn't something everyone will like. The thing about BL2 is that it's so goddam engaging. By that I mean you fire up the game, and within seconds you can be in an insane firefight. Difficulty settings are spot on, weapons are awesome and extremely varied. Overall a fantastic game, this one is my GOTY 2012. Better yet, we've still got three DLC's to look forward to!",9,XBOX 360
The devs did a great job on this one,8,XBOX 360
"The BEST MMO type of game on consoles to date!! This game should be in the running for game of the year!! Lets get to it!! Graphics = 9 Yes there still Cell Shaded. That said they are gorgeous! They are a step up from the original and there are a lot of new things and additions to the style they have developed that make your eyeballs want to pop out of your head! There are a few hiccups and graphical glitches here and there that could have been polished out but over all the game is beautiful!! Gameplay = 10 The time you spend with your friends helping them out, leveling them up, finishing quests, trading weapons, and generally just having fun seems endless! The world seems Pandora seems alive and well, even if it is out to kill you every second your in it! The characters are very stylized and all are full of life as you would expect from the developers that gave life to claptrap! There are lots of creatures and baddies to kill of all different kinds and finding the right weapon for the job is half the fun. The boss fights are basically all about finding the soft spot and hitting it till the boss dies but its still fun and a good challenge. There are a butt load of weapons! They all act differently according to the manufacturer and the type of stats they have. The levels seem a little more linear than they did in the first game, this is something I personally loved and felt that it kept the game fast and furious instead of wandering around aimless in the same droll looking desert the whole game. Music/Sound EFX = 8 They went with the Dubstep sound track on this one... that said ..its a bit weak for Dubstep. For the most part the sound EFX are the same as the original game and don't really change much. So personally there's nothing really thought provoking or groundbreaking here. The only thing that really redeems the soundtrack is the voice acting! If it weren't for the great voice acting and character style this game would be an audio mess!! That said the characters are full of life and humor most of the time! Controls = 9 The Controls are the same as the first game. Nothing has changed but they still feel natural and don't get in the way of the fun of the game! I guess it would be nice to have a little more customization to the controls but I really didn't find my self having problems with the defaults. Replay = 10 Lots of re-playability with 5 classes and 1 expansion already out, it seems like there will be plenty of content to come. This game should be in every ones rotation for a long time to come! Over All! = 9 This is a Must have game for anyone who owns a gaming platform!!",9,XBOX 360
"I'm a big fan of Borderlands 1, Borderlands 2 is much of the same with a minor exception. i felt the main story was a bit lacking. But this game is still amazing and recommended to all.",8,XBOX 360
"I can't stop playing this game. It is so much fun. I enjoyed Borderlands 1, but I got bored of it fairly quick. This is not the case with 2. Over 60 hours and I am still loving it. It follows the same formula as Borderlands 1 but it improves on pretty much everything. It might not be the perfect game, but I am giving it a perfect 10, as I have enjoyed evey minute.",10,XBOX 360
"Never were a fan of looting games... thought i'd check this one out (also for coop with my wife)... it blew our mind. The gameplay in combination with the comicstyle, the looting system and all other features is simply ADDICTING (especially Splitcreen). Let me list up what i like: - Many variations of enemys and environments keep the game interesting even after tons of hours of playing - Different types of Rakks, Bandits, Midgets, Stalkers, Skags, Bullymongs, Threshers, Robots, Endbosses and more... (DLCs bring you more types of enemys like Pirates...) - Different environments in smooth transition: Deserts, Hills, Ice, Industrial, Urban and more... - TONS of weapons and gear: It will never be boring to use weapons and gear, because of the large variation - 50 Hours BEAST campaign: Unique characters in a funny world and a tough storyline keep you entertained and excited - Many comprehensive elements in story, environment, gear and characters - Remarkable villain-endboss, which leaves footprints everywhere in the world - No cutscenes, you experience most of the story in egoperspective - Many Endbossfights - Witty anecdotes - Many quests that give you a deeper look into Pandora - Balanced, not overpowered or underpowered classes - Motivating gameplay mechanics, that prevent that you get bored",10,XBOX 360
"I'm impressed. BL2 is everything BL1 was and more. An even bigger variety of weapons and plenty of laughs. There's virtually nothing that hasn't been improved upon from an already entertaining game. The only downside I would say, and this is just my opinion, is no longer being able to pop a target's limbs off. I had hoped turning on the gore would cure that. But alas, it did not. Perhaps the purpose for that is future DLC/$. But there's a satisfying level of sadism when you take an enemy down with any of the elements be it from a weapon or an exploding barrel..",9,XBOX 360
"My brother originally picked this title up because he and I love co-op games, and BL2 had well-reviewed co-op play. In this respect, and many others, it did not disappoint. Although there are occasional glitches, gameplay is generally smooth and very fun. The incredible variety of weapons and customization throughout really adds to the game, and there's just the right proportion of humor to gameplay. Definitely a great buy, especially if you're looking for a game to play with someone else.",10,XBOX 360
"did not disappoint, great game. played several of the characters all the way to 50. wish there was more of the amazing orange guns but if you want a game you can pick up and get your moneys worth out **** this is it.",8,XBOX 360
"I bought this game uncertain if I would enjoy it, but I took the chance and it was one of the best decisions I ever made as a religious gamer. Borderlands 2 is a genre like no other, being an RPG/FPS and feels like so many different great games all wrapped into one. I have played it non-stop (breaks for work and food of course) since the purchase and won't stop until I beat it completely. The guns are amazing, the story is great, and the characters are funny and original. I've heard the co-op is tons of fun but I have been playing solo and having a blast.",8,XBOX 360
"Only one of the masterpieces of this console generation! While other game developers fall all over themselves trying to ape Call of Duty, Gearbox has perfected the cooperative experience and makes teaming up with your friends to fight the machine an addictive and endlessly gratifying experience.",10,XBOX 360
"Twice I tried to force myself to finish this game, and twice I have decided it is not worth my time. Sub-mediocre writing and story pasted on a 20 hour gear check with invisible walls and **** physics. Don't waste your time on this crap, its all hype.",0,XBOX 360
"An incredibly juvenile adventure which gets old real fast. By gritting my teeth I made it to level 15, but by then I was too bored of the variable difficulty curve, running out of ammo despite being conservative with it, the terribly poor vehicles (halo warthog's were better), the uninspiring environments, the jaggies and graphic design ****.. the head bashing weapon randomiser comparision engine. It beggars belief that others actually finished this lame turkey and would actually pony up for the DLC. If the game was composed of the first 20 minutes being repeated for 20 hours, I don't think anyone would notice.",6,XBOX 360
"The game itself is so overrated, gameplay is repetitive, the feel of it is a huge letdown. ... Meh. Don't get it, it gets boring after an hour of playing. You really don't want to play it more than an hour or so.",3,XBOX 360
"• Borderlands 2 is a game where you run around an open environment while shooting all manner of crazy creature, robot and bandit in the face and collecting the various items that pop out of them so that you can then take on larger more powerful creatures for even better loot. • Frequently well executed humor but relies heavily on geek culture references and juvenile jokes that struggle to be heard over gunfire and other NPC conversations. • A horrible ""walk here, now here, now kill this then walk over there"" quest system made worse by a poor map and tracking system. • A heavy co-op focus that includes such enemies as the guy with the shield that needs to be flanked. • While still arguably the best RPG loot grab / first person hybrid game, there is a clear sense of trying to do more than the first and failing to execute on some otherwise great ideas but it is still a great time to be had by a group of friends.",7,XBOX 360
"I have played this game offline till the end of the game. The story was great, the weapons feel amazing and there are a lot of different enemies. The best thing of the game is the voice acting and the interactions between friends and enemies. I was impressed and I was about to give this game a 8 or higher. But after I went online I lost my save.. and I was not happy with that. Thats something 2K needs to fix in the future!",7,XBOX 360
"They took the original borderlands game and improved everything about it. There are a lot of options for character customization and lots of options on the different skill trees to change the way your character plays. The action is intense and the looting is addictive. If you don't have it yet you should pick it up, you won't regret it.",10,XBOX 360
The game is solid and is a much improved version of Borderlands 1. That being said this formula gets tired (at least for me) over time so I finished it with two different characters (Zero and Axton) then stopped and have no intention of bothering with the add-ons. To me it seems everyone races to level 50 then struggles to find Bee shields with slightly better stats than their other one and the fun of finding unique weapons eventually dies out a bit as well as finding all the collectables in the game. Absolutely worth a play and a great game but can't give it higher than an 8.,8,XBOX 360
This game is fantastic... its so much more fun than 1 see my review here at my school's site ****/2012/10/30/borderlands-2-sets-the-bar-for-shooters/,10,XBOX 360
"Have you played the first Borderlands? Did you enjoy it? If you did play it and enjoy it, chances are that you'll enjoy this too. If you played the first one and didn't enjoy it, then stay far away from this game. Now lets get to a review for people that are new to the series. Borderlands 2 looks good. There's plenty of character customization. It controls well, although shooting with any sort of accuracy is impossible until you level up a few times. The first couple of hours will feel like you have a vibrator attached to all your guns. And the guns. There's so many of them. Too many to tell you the truth. And that's one of the main problems. A shooter should be about shooting, not inventory management and comparing statistics. I miss the days when there were no more than 10 guns in a game. Looking for a good story? Look elsewhere. Like the first Borderlands, you'll find yourself doing non-stop fetch quests. I assume they have something to do with the story, but I couldn't be bothered to care. Something about vaults and vault-hunters. Some guy named Handsome Jack that wants to hog all the glory and riches for himself and sets out to stop you. Not sure where you and your party came from, but who cares. There's loot to be found. In summary, if you enjoyed the first Borderlands then you'll like this one as much, maybe a little bit more. If you didn't like the first one, stay away. This is pretty much more of the same. If you're new to the series, I'd suggest renting first.",6,XBOX 360
I have played many hours of this game and can honestly say it is fantastic!!! After all this time since playing Borderlands I forgot just how awesome it was until I played this fantastic upgrade from the original. This game is hilarious and the game play is still fantastic. If this game didn't seem like a complete copy of the original I'd give it a perfect 10.,9,XBOX 360
"This will probably be the best game released by a major studio, that isn't a huge franchise (Halo, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed), this year. That's hugely significant, and yet Borderlands 2 surpasses any and all expectations that come with that. The game has a fantastic hook- basically Diablo with guns. That's a very interesting concept on paper, but when actually applied, is even better than you can imagine. You're constantly looking for better stuff, swapping and trading to completely arm yourself against the masses of enemies on Pandora. And trust me, you'll need it. Along with the guns, you have 4 (5 if you preordered or bought it) to choose from. Along with that, the story is good. You're tasked with bringing down Handsome Jack, a tyrant who has Pandora in his grasp. This time it's not some lame, thrown together mess, like the first one. Rather than that, this story is compelling, emotional, and just good as a whole. Also, the game has stunning graphics. Even on a console they look vibrant, and I've seen it on PC as well. They're astonishing. The cel-shaded look really brings a slick, sugary layer to the violence that goes on in the game. Overall, this game has almost no flaws that I can think of. Therefore, a perfect score. 10/10",10,XBOX 360
"Good Lord! Since when do graphics make a game good? Furthermore those aren't bad graphics, it's just a different art style than most games, when did people stop reviewing games based on replay value? As for the gore, someone mentioned that it's toned down in this game, and I have no idea what they're talking about. As an avid fan but reasonable critic of the first game I can confidently tell you that this game takes a great idea, and improves on absolutely everything. The voice acting is great and is complimented by some great writing, the settings are magnificent and diverse (unlike the first which had cool landscapes but they were all pretty similar), there is also actually a plot in BL2 as opposed to its predecessor, the guns are cooler, the skill trees are more balanced, and they added some skill tree options that are geared more towards multiplayer without forsaking us single player gamers. This game literally improved on everything from the first, and in my opinion the only way you won't enjoy this game is if you don't like FPS, RPGs, or both (or if you straight up don't get what all the fuss is about with this franchise, which is fine because everyone has their own tastes). Finally the vault is actually worth opening; instead of being disappointed by a few low rarity weapons at the end of the game, I was rewarded with two legendary weapons (rarest in the game), plenty of other valuable guns, and an itch to start ""True Vault Hunter Mode"". In conclusion, if you like FPS, RPGs, or both then check this game out, if FPS or RPGs aren't your thing then maybe not, but everyone should at least give it a try if they're given a chance; I live in a house with three non-gamer roommates and two of them are already hooked.",10,XBOX 360
"This game is fun and guaranty a long game play, but the at one point the it get difficulty to get nice weapons and other items and you need to kill over an over certain boss or enemies to see if you can get a good item. I dont want to farm like a mmorpg four hours to get the the best weapons in the game.",6,XBOX 360
"A great game with a unique art style and tongue in cheek humour. The technical side is great with good textures but let down by texture **** quests are more varied than its predecessor, but let down by some repetitive fetch quests. Overall 9.3/10-Outstanding",9,XBOX 360
"This game is excellent. Graphics and gameplay are fine but nothing too showy, though personally I find the indie pop art feel to the game to be fantastic. The real value though comes from the excellent writing. The story arch is well done and the optional quests are well-worth it. Great one liners from a host of characters and the main cadre is very endearing. It is very easy to get deeply involved and the respawn of units and bosses makes just mucking about great fun. This game is perfect if you are looking for something to throw a hundred or so hours of fun into. Plus, don't forget future DLC and Co-Op options.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 does a great job of building off of the success of the first game in nearly every way. In terms of graphics, you're not getting anything too new here, however the fine details and new customization skins really add flair, allowing users to personalize their adventure even more. The greatest thing about this series, is there is ALWAYS something to do - even if by chance you complete all of the side quests, there's plenty of fun to be had in roaming Pandora and exploring new things.",9,XBOX 360
"More of the same but still a great game. The hilarious characters with excellent writing and flawless voice acting brings the world of Pandora to life and exploring the new locations is a good time. The gameplay remains the same as it's predecessor, gunplay is satisfying and trying out new guns is always a joy. It's in the overall structure of the missions I think the game falters a bit, like the original, it's just tedious back and forth doing boring tasks and to many side quests feels like chores. And the boss fights are annoying and badly designed. Better then the original? Yes in every way, but it still remains very similar to it. So if you didn't like the first game, you'll probably wont like Borderlands 2. But if you did, you'll have a great time, and make sure you bring some friends!",8,XBOX 360
"When playing a game that plays like DLC, you might as well just wait for all the DLC in one complete package. When you expect little, you get games like this. I loved the first one, bought the GOTY about a year and a half ago, and this sequel actually seems to fall a bit short of the first. Absolutely terrible and cringe-worthy humor from (pick your least favorite sitcom and insert here). The story seems to get in the way of the gameplay, and makes less and less sense as the game wears on. Wear on it will, as the last ten hours of the game are basically fetch missions that have you scratching your head each time and wondering why the game didn't have an endpoint earlier. Play in coop, as then you won't have to listen to any dialogue in the game at all. About as good as Gearbox's last game, Duke Nukem Forever, yet less funny and less classy. There is sure to be the complete DLC collection to this DLC collection in about a year, priced at about forty bucks compared to the $100, or close to it, you are going to pay in installments. Forget layaway, just wait. Not sure how long this review will stay up, as Gearbox is teaming up with Metacritic to let you know that you must like the game.",0,XBOX 360
"This would have been my favorite game ever. Shortly after release the game started freezing on me and thousands of other players as you can see in the gearbox forums essentially locking us completely out of the game. With no apology or patch, this is unnaceptable. I paid 60$ for a game I can't play. That's why it gets a zero instead of a 10. I'll never buy another gearbox game due to their lack of fixes and pure greed. Randy Pitchford deletes tweets when they talk about the freeze and ignores the issue. It doesn't matter how good the game is if you can't play it. Shameful.",1,XBOX 360
"I loved the first Borderlands, I picked it up thinking it was going to be a deep and rewarding RPG but when i put it in it was more like the smooth first person shooting of Call of duty, mixed with Rpg elements and the enemies are weird. Now ive scooped together sixty dollars and figured i would try this one out. The moment i was let loose to shoot stuff and loot, i was having an immense amount of fun. You;ll notice that the gunplay is a lot more satifying then the last game, and a lot smoother. The game says that there are even more guns in this game. Well from what ive noticed there is a lot more guns. But the system is basically the same, because youll notice that ninety percent of the guns you pick up are complete **** but they have tweaked the grenades and the shields as well so that each one is different no matter what. Ive found grenade mods that when i threw it four flamethrowers come out and deal massive fire damage. Cool. The character classes are the same but there abilities are different. The commando still throws out a turret but it can do alot more things thanks to the skill tree for you character. This game is very good and if your still wondering whether or not to pick it up stop thinking about it, and buy it. Even if you havent played the first game you will enjoy the hell out of this game its really fun, and an immense time sink.",9,XBOX 360
"Love this game in all aspects. Great Story,Sound, Graphics and Game-play. Must own for any Borderlands, BioSchock or end of the world fans. Looking forward to all additional DLC. 10/10",10,XBOX 360
"I completed borderlands 2's normal play through and i am now about half-way through true vault hunter mode. so i though it would be timed to put up my review. I really enjoyed the game overall. it has good graphics, lovable characters, a good leveling system, and a crap ton of guns. Not to mention a storyline that is vastly improved. On the other hand, everything from BL2 seems to be recycled from BL1. after 20 hours or so in game, everything starts to feel bin there done that, and kind of gets stale and boring. Even though looting is fun, 99.99% of the loot is worse than what you already have. its a real pain in the butt to find guns that are on par with your level. even then stores sell guns that are about 5 levels below me. i also find enemies scaling to be off, iv'e run into enemies that are 5 or 6 levels below me that can kill me with a few shots (doesn't sound right to me). Those issues aside, i think its time for Gearbox to allow players to create their own characters. The main playable characters have little to no back round or story, not to mention they are really just a re skinning of the characters from BL1. i would also like to have seen more outfits for each character. All the skins are just color swaps. Overall , the fun in BL2 can be quickly overshadowed by the childish (un-funny) humor, or some odd game design choices.",5,XBOX 360
"I am not the most ardent FPS playing out there. I do not enjoy most FPS games and generally find them lacking. I tried borderlands 2 because it was supposed to be an action rpg/fps. I found that the action rpg side of the game was very lacking. The weapons were bad in general. Little i found was of use. The beginning of the game was just an excuse for self flagellation. I felt miserable and forced my way through the first few hours of the game hoping it would get better as i actually got my action skill and started spending points on other things, but it never really got much better for me. I don't understand why I was forced to wait 5 levels to get the only key difference between the classes.",5,XBOX 360
"I became somewhat board of it, I attempted to play Borderlands 1 but never got into it, my cousin dragged me into playing BL2 and I got to say playing that game was more like a chore for me as I did not want to offend my cousin as he really wanted me to enjoy the game. The game makes my head hurt, people will say that your just not smart enough to understand and appreciate the dynamics and complexity of the game. But in all honesty its too much for me, the plot doesn't captivate me and it doesn't drive me to through. If the graphics weren't enough the whole concept doesn't grasp me and its to much work to actually enjoy the game.",3,XBOX 360
"Let me start by saying I LOVED #1. I'm trying to love #2 but i can't. It's so repetitive and same thing over and over. I didn't finish it and not sure i will -Game was fun but got boring quickly. This review was for single player only, as i never go on-line.",7,XBOX 360
"If you were a fan of the first title and asked yourself ""Boy I sure could use more guns, loot, enemies, and bigger maps"" than look no further. Borderlands 2 exceeds everything the first game had to offer. The new characters are fantastic and very diverse, but also very zany. The more storied focus campaign is a welcoming addition with a robust group of interesting characters. The core game though is still the co-op loot fest that everyone loved in the first game. So grab some friends or go alone because there is much to be explored in Pandora.",10,XBOX 360
"****. There isn't much more to be said here. This was my first borderlands game. This game had me hooked from start to end, and then sunk me back in the new game + mode. Utterly brilliant design, simplistic yet with deep RPG mechanics blended in a FPS environment and an amazing artistic style, and let's not forget the best part .. the humor !!! So so funny, every character has so much personality. Can't wait for the DLC and any future games.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2's tagline should read ""For the community, by the community"". I say this because literally every single aspect that i did not not like from the original Borderlands has been removed or amped up to be an enjoyable aspect of the game. The narrative is superb both funny and at times gut wrenching at others. Playing through once isnt enough as beating the game the first time unlocks True Vault Hunter Mode which raises the difficulty, changes enemy names and looks and includes more powerful loot and a chance at hitting the level cap. The NRA should endorse this wonderful game",9,XBOX 360
"While not as good as the original Borderlands, this is still a pretty good game that only suffers by the consistent dumbing-down of the RPG elements and other details to (supposedly) attract a wider audience. In a game supposedly about loot, there is actually less of it and fewer different types in the sequel, than in Borderlands. Strange but true and this data is backed up on the Gearbox forums. No more weapon profieicneis, no more gun stats like zooom, recoil or sway, etc. Not all is bad news, and along with the streamlining negatives, the missions are a bit better and the locales more varied, but it can still get boring and Borderlands 2 doesn't manage to hit the same mood or environment level that the original did. Sometimes playing Borderlands, the mood and ambiance was so heavy you almost felt like you were out in a desolate wasteland, but you'll never forget you're playing a videogame with the sequel. There is an old saying that ""the Devil's in the details"" and by removing so many of the important ""details"" from the hit original, Gearbox seems to forgotten that.",6,XBOX 360
"Worth the wait - better than the first one, and I can't put this game down. If you like loot-based games (who doesn't) and Diablo 3 was a disappointment to you (it probably was) this is your huckleberry",10,XBOX 360
"This is... a terribly decent first person shooter. However, the biggest problem with this game is that I already played Borderlands 1, and the game knows that Borderlands 1 existed. It brings in many of the older characters, including the playable characters, and I got some bonuses for having played Borderlands 1. But, Borderlands 1 had a problem - repetition. And, Borderlands 2 falls into the same problem. More so then the first 1 because there is literally nothing new for a player. What do we get as bonus? More weapons, more enemies, and more annoying claptraps. The same old game, just reiterated and polished. It's like a guy who says something interesting, you think about it a bit and say ""hey, that's a good idea,"" and then a week later the same guy comes over, and says the same thing, but worded better. We get it, you have a good idea. Don't repeat yourself endlessly, just better. Go ahead and try something new. Try something that questions the industry. Something like Borderlands 1. Do something bigger and better and completely and utterly insane. Because Borderlands 2 is sad because 1 was so successful and such a risk, and Borderlands 2 says ""Hey, we were successful, let's just do it again, and we'll be successful."" These risks, you have to take them. Sure, I'd recommend 2 over 1, but what would I call a better game? 1, because it took a risk. Borderlands 1 is like jumping into a lake and seeing if there's piranhas in it. And luckily, there wasn't any. But Borderlands 2 jumps into the same lake. 1 already said that it was safe, how about you try something new 2. I hope this doesn't start to stagnate, because this is a great IP that could, and I hope, evolve and challenge the industry it is in. But right now, it will stay still, and fester. And if we don't try something new, then this will become the new CoD, prettier, but the same.",6,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is the ultimate four-player Role-Playing Shooter loot fest. Combining invention and evolution, Borderlands 2 features characters, skills, environments, enemies, weapons and equipment, which come together to create the most entertaining experience that I have ever played. Borderlands 2 tries to appeal to fans of first-person shooters, lootfests, and RPGs alike. The original focused more on shooting and looting, then anything else. Its story was clearly an afterthought, and the RPG element was unimpressive. Borderlands 2 thrives where the original failed. The story, this time around is very entertaining. I find myself plotting the different ways I will kill Handsome Jack, the games antagonist. For reasons spoiler related, I will stop talking about the story. Side-quests are as strange as in the original. The missions are far more diverse, for example in one mission I",10,XBOX 360
"As a fan of the original Borderlands, this was the game I was looking forward to ever since it was announced, I had high expectations, but at the same time knew certain key features would remain the same, because why fix what is broken? After finishing the game twice 100+ hours played, I can honestly say, the thing that people need to understand is that they did NOT improve on everything from the original. In some cases they straight up downgraded the game. I mean sure, in the aspects you expect it to, they improved the game slightly, multiplayer is better intigrated, graphics are slightly (very slightly) improved, menus, etc. But not the stuff that was truly important. Let me ask you this: When you say Borderlands, what are the 3 things that come to mind? Graphics, Popculture refrences and Story? No? Right the correct answer is Co-Op, Guns, Fun, and they failed all 3 of those aspects of the game. Lets start with with what I think is the most important thing about Borderlands is finding new and exciting new guns that are better then the one you were using previously, same as games like Diablo, but they failed big time in that aspect, where in the original Borderlands Loot chests were common, and finding epic and legendary weapons were relatively common, they are definitely not this time around, Weapon chests are usually filled with junk this time around, and I can honestly say I found maybe 10 epic/orange guns in total, totally lacking, but that isnt even the worst part of it, the weapons themselfs never quite feel right, they always have a negative feel to it, either the recoil is too high, small clip, consumes too many bullets at once, no scope, etc. You will never, EVER find that perfect gun in this game (again unlike Borderlands 1, where that was easily possible), there are severe limitations to weapons now. The weapon manufactures always dictate the weapon stats and thereby the 87 billion gun argument is gone down the drain. The second argument is co-op, it doesnt work well this time around because again the most important thing is gone. In the first Borderlands the character talent trees were made specifically for certain weapon types, modecai was a sniper/handgun guy, roland was assault rifles/shotguns, lilith was SMGs, etc, It was further encouraged in the first game to stick to certain weapon types by giving experience to weapon types. When you leveled up, say, assault rifles, you'd get more weapon damage, faster reload speed and less recoil. they threw that all out of the window so that everyone can be good at each weapon type, which is good in theory but it means sharing is impossible, who wants that sniper rifle? Everyone. Who wants that shotgun? Everyone, who wants that SMG? Everyone. Not a good design decision. The last thing I found severely lacking was the writing, especially the main story missions. The humor just wasnt there for me. Poorly done internet memes and pop culture refrences constantly. Every once in a while you get a good laugh in a side quest, perhaps, but the jokes, generally arent as fun this time around. I feel they focuses too much on aspects of the game that didnt make the original great, and limited the ones that did matter. 6/10, not a trainwreck, but not exciting either. Definitely not GOTY material.",6,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is an awesome game. I didn't play the first game and still understood the whole story of this game. I completed the main story quest by myself and it was good but i can't help thinking it would be better playing through it co-op, so i would recommend playing through with friends. Overall this game is excellent.",8,XBOX 360
"This game takes you back to Pandora in a great way. The gameplay, guns, story, characters, and guns have been drastically improved compared to the original Borderlands and it makes it a fantastic game to play. At every moment of the game something (or someone) is trying to kill you and you get plenty of opportunities to try and kill them right back. This game is utterly lovely to play.",10,XBOX 360
"I honestly didn't know much about this series. Doing research i read that the first borderlands game was somewhat like rage. which i had played so that's how i made the comparison. So my buddy calls me and says borderlands 2 is coming out were all gonna play online. So I bought it just to go along with it. To my surprise I was blown away how awesome this game truly is. Anyone who loves mmo's or loves games that have weapon upgrades,skills, talent trees,etc. Then this is the title for you. The co-op is flawless playing with a friend or just someone random is very enjoyable the mechanics the great voice dialogue and fun boss fights just work perfectly. This is not a rental this is a must have of 2012",9,XBOX 360
"This game was meant for so many types of gamers, and succeeds at every style it serves up. If you a) like to shoot things b) like to collect stuff c) like to explore d) like memorable, entertaining characters e) like to game with friends ... Borderlands 2 delivers, with a funny, polished game you will be playing for hours and hours. It oozes atmosphere with a colorful art style, and gives you a shooting mechanic to rival Halo or Call of Duty in precision. (You can fix your controller buttons to emulate whatever FPS you play most.) I played the original Borderlands, including all the DLC, and didn't think I could possibly play more of the same game, but Gearbox managed to improve on every aspect of the original. Now I'm hooked again.",10,XBOX 360
"This review is going to be quick if you have friends, love to collect guns, love rpgs then this is the perfect game for you. If you played the first borderlands the story wasn't that good, I don't remember the story actually, for borderlands 2 it is different the story is solid, the gameplay is excellent, it is a pretty challenging game. And trust me you will be playing this game for a long time. The first borderlands was awesome this one is amazing. It is really worth your money and time. If you want the season pass don't hesitate buy it.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 brings you back to Pandora for another wild goose chase with some brand new vault hunters. However this time the focus is on something much more important than the vault. After Roland, Lillith, Mordecai and Brick awakened the destroyer eridium has been spewing out of the ground faster then grass, it has also shown the whereabouts of another vault. After Hyperion had a close eye on the operations going down with Atlas, the Crimson Lance and the original Vault hunters they decide to move in and go on the hunt for the vault lead by the tyrannous Handsome Jack. Invited by Jack the new vault hunters (Axton, Maya, Salvador and Zero) you soon realise you are being led into a trap and escape into the plains of Pandora on a epic 50+ hour adventure to stop Jack opening the vault and allow Pandora to be at peace for longer than five minutes. Lots of old characters return as well as many new faces, a loot chest full of side quests and an epic storyline full of unexpected twists, turns and heart wrenching moments. Borderlands 2 is a must buy for fans of the series and as good a place as any to pick up the game and start if you haven't played the first. A real GOTY contender",10,XBOX 360
"This game was highly over rated compared to Borderlands. The leveling does not map to solo player game play and neither do the weapons. The side quests are the same way especially if you do the ones in ""The Fridge"". Animation was poor at best as were what little interaction you had with Roland, Lilith or Modecai. The fast travel network was terrible especially if you were in the middle of a specific area and had to make your way back. You could only quit the game and save it in hopes you would get back to the start. Enemies re-spawned over and over and way to quickly. As a solo player reached a level of 38 and the weapons were terrible. Almost impossible to reach Level 50 to battle Thresher and skill trees were cumbersome and not leveled correctly to achieve needed attributes for fighting. Played Vault Leve difficultyl after first playthrough as a Solo player and it was almost impossible because of leveling and poor weapons. Did all side quests and explored all areas in detail. Chests were very mediocre at best for what you had to do to get to them. Scenery was a makeover especially going back to Fyrestone for those who played Borderlands. It was like playing in a poorly illustrated comic book. Will not purchase the DLC's when it comes out. Was not worth the money. Again, feel as it is another game in the marketplace where cost cutting was the norm to maximize profits. Feel the consumer looses again.",2,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 was an interesting and fun experience. I played the first and just knew I had to have the next. I was not dissapointed. But my eyes were also opened to some errors. The story itself was actually pretty interesting this time around and the end of the game is worth the experience. (you also get more than some dollars from tannis as in the first game). All of the side quests are interesting and rewarding. New enemy types help get the game away from the very few types in the first. Sure youll still find yourself with our psycho friends a lot of the time, but even they have some new friends. Badass enemies feel more frequent, talent trees are perfectly laid out, and the co op is fun, but sometimes not rewarding. Playing with anybody that isnt your friend is impossible, but with a friend it can still be an amazing co op experience. The only problem with co op is there isnt any strategy. That shouldnt be what people come to Borderlands 2 for but the co op acclaim can be misleading to few. What im saying is the co op can be a blast with friends, but the fights wont be too challenging. Borderlands 2 is a shoot and loot not an in depth challenging tactical rpg.",8,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is an amazing game. The writing is so much better than the first one. The only down side I can see of this game is you need to play with your friends, because if you don't the game becomes a, 'go here kill this guy, collect these things bring them back, here is a gun that's not as good as the one that just dropped from that guy, repeat', with your friends Borderlands 2 explodes into craziness. With more people playing the enemies become harder and more abundant and with more enemies that are difficult comes better loot drops. Plus there is nothing like trying to shoot a marauder that is hiding behind a barricade and your buddy the siren uses phaselocks him out of cover for you so you can get that critical head-shot. Also Tiny Tina is an awesome character go find her and do all of her quests.",8,XBOX 360
"Bigger, better and way more bad ass. That has been said before regarding sequels to other games, but it has never been more true than with Borderlands 2. The tweaks to the classes may throw some people off at first, but give the new characters a little time to get to know them and you'll find pure gold. The game seems more balanced overall, with tougher, smarter enemies and the need to utilize each characters strengths to ensure success. If you played Borderlands and even liked it a little bit, you should be playing Borderlands 2 right now. Thank you Gearbox for another gem. I wish there were more developers like you guys that put this much thought, love and attention to detail into co-op games. Borderlands 2 is easily among the front-runners for game of the year - and one of the best co-op games in recent memory.",10,XBOX 360
"One word review: BOREDLANDS... Oh my god, it IS boring... An awful sad, boring to the teeth game. Even worst than the ridiculous first installment, this train wreck **** is dull, predictable and generic to the extreme. Same old same old mediocre FPS game disguised as a very bad written RPG. Avoid at all costs.",0,XBOX 360

"Very great game. They really seemed to fix a lot of the nonsense from Borderlands 1. You NEED to play this with friends to really enjoy it to the full extent, but a damn good game nonetheless.",8,XBOX 360
"This is a humorous and thoughtful addition to the Borderlands series. Guns and baddies get bigger, better and more powerful. Some familiar faces help along the way, along with some new personalities. The graphics were that same almost-cartoon-like design that I greatly enjoyed in the first game. Overall, the game was very good. My few complaints that kept this game from a 10/10 from my personal opinion. 1) I found Zer0's skill-tree to be incredibly disappointing. I'm replaying as Maya and already on level 10 I'm much happier. Going from Mordecai with Bloodwing to Zero and some nearly worthless 5 second decoy that was used more for escaping than flanking... was disappointing. Most of his skill points did exactly the same thing as the badass tokens. 2) I felt that the original characters had massive personality changes from 1 to 2. I was personally annoyed over this, but it doesn't really ruin the gameplay.",8,XBOX 360
I made a 8 minute review for the Xbox360 version of BL2 and I am certain that I am the only person in the world so far that has made a review for the game and gotten every achievement which made me play in other ways no one else played the game and finding various bugs and different ways to play the game. Heres the review ****/watch?v=nrja37eBRX4,9,XBOX 360
"Masterpiece! A review written after 70 hours of game play and completion of normal mode... Recently, FPS have become a bore, and Rpg's have taken a wrong turn. Borderlands 2 takes the best of two old worlds gone sour, and makes them sweet again! Seriously. I literally have to start with commending: A bad ass intro! it will bring a tier to an artists eye, and motivate even the most unlikely of gamers. Controls: Let's talk about the core mechanics of this gem, and how it translates from your sweating palms, too your watering eyes. The controls are slick (on the 360), I never felt so comfortable with a games controls, especially a FPS. I get the feeling that I'm 100% in control, and no mistakes will be made unless they were my own. FPS Mechanics: In my opinion, it's a very realistic shooter, and this topic deserves some recognition. The reticules and kickback on almost every weapon feel as realistic as any COD game, but have a chance to be further interesting through RPG elements such as; getting an SMG which improves accuracy (shrinks reticule) while shooting. I can't express how much flavor this adds to a FPS. Every weapon feels different even if it's comparing two of the same weapons types, such as two assault rifles. When adding a wacky element like shooting explosive shots from an assault rifle, the mechanics adapt to a realistic feel such as; reloading time increases as the character is stuffing explosive ammo into the gun, or a delay in the burst, or a spread in the reticule. No matter how ridiculous the weapon modification may sound, the game adjusts to realism through mechanics. I commend the FPS mechanics and adore the RPG elements. A perfect and seamless blend that should not go UN-noticed! Art Style: WOW! simply wow! it speaks for itself, but my favorite part is that you journey around the color wheel, with environments dedicated to colors. Blue ice-lands, waterfalls, & dams. Orange & yellow dry lands / deserts. Green toxic swamps, and highlands. Purple Errideum lands, red volcanic finally! I truly appreciate the beauty of the color wheel in this game! Story: Story telling is important in games! The best part about this game is that it doesn't try to hard to be professional, but it delivers a rich heartfelt story that grabs you and **** you in. I remember every aspect of plot, story telling, and the characters which delivered them. It's an emotional roller coaster of feelings which has you on the edge of your seat and almost falling off it! A good game will leave you feeling love for the characters, upset or angry at times, and wanting to reap vengeance, which will carry you through. That's exactly what this game is, and does! Some people actually gave this game a bad review, because they were emotionally broken or depressed with some of the story outcomes. That's Brilliant! I personally am left wanting to relive the experience even after completing the game. Some games like Halo: (not trying to bash, but making a point) I got lost in the story because every detail had a detail and the game tried to hard to cover to much professional explanation, and I got bored / fed-up with it. In BL2, everything has a purpose, but doesn't rabble on and on about it. Simple, to the point, and very rewarding. Sequel: This game is the definition of what makes a true sequel! If you played borderlands 1, you will not only be rewarded in game, but your soul will be rewarded through relationships and story telling references. A lot of the NPC's from borderlands 1 have made an appearance here, and they even talk / reference stories from borderlands 1. You don't need to play BL1 to understand what's happening (unlike the mass effect series (which is a great thing!)) However, you will appreciate and love the characters that much more! And possibly even want to go back and revisit the first game! This is a true sequel, and brilliant marketing system for the franchise. Questing: I HATE mindless questing for petty rewards... Optional side missions, are just as rewarding as the main story, and this is why story telling in games is so important to me. They literally **** you into wanting to know what happens in a minor side quest. You build a relationship with characters which become meaningful to you, and curiosity pushes you into finding out what happens. The reward is the outcome of the side plot (and often hilarious), and as a bonus you get a sweet ass weapon and some exp! Game designers really should look to borderlands as a base mesh of what makes a good game! Re-playability: Don't fix what's not broken! Borderlands 2 kept what was working well, and made it better! All the classes feel unique and deserve a full play through. with 100+ hours of amazing game play PER-character. your looking at a 400+ hour game with guaranteed amazing DLC already in production. You got yourself the best re-playable game of the decade (and that is an understatement!)",10,XBOX 360
"Great game even better than the 1st love the charectars, story and humor. The side quests kept me interested for hours. old favourites make a fantastic return and gameplay has been vastly improved as well. I tilt my hat (if i had one)",10,XBOX 360
"Exactly what a sequel should be, It takes everything good about the first game improves it, and adds its own flavor and humor into what was already an amazingly perfect game. Endless hours of exploring side quests and a thrilling story (in addition to play through 2) Borderlands 2 is not one to disappoint.",10,XBOX 360
"I just finished my second play through of Borderlands 2 and thought i should give my opinion. This game is really really fun, if your playing alone or with friends the tight shooter gameplay and the loot driven system really makes you want to come back and play more, although this game does have some issues most of them have to do with the bosses, almost every boss is this game felt a little bit to easy during my solo play through (i was the commando) mostly i would throw my turret down and shoot for 10 seconds and win. but then I started playing with friends which increased the difficulty and made it much more fun, basically this game is a 9/10 when solo and 10/10 with 3-4 people.",9,XBOX 360
"I have been a huge fan of Borderlands since I first heard about it, the original trailers were nothing exciting, but the idea caught me. When the game was released however, it was nothing like my expectations, it was far better. It took a fairly simlpe idea, and made it great. When Borderlands 2 arrived I was blown away. The areas look fantasic, there is plently to see and do, with areas that are large enough to have a good explore in, but small enough if you run and gun through the areas. The humour that has followed the game is very well written, I have caught myself laughing / groaning at some of the jokes, especially Claptrap, but the serious side is there as well, albeit still tounge in cheek for the most part. Its a very easy game to pick up and play. Some areas are unforgiving, but I never feel that dying is obtrusive to the game or the enjoyment. There may be some people that would argue ""that would be the point of dying"" but to me its the more enjoyment of the landscapes and the characters. The quests that I have played through so far have been failry simplistic, but an addition of some optional side quests and quest rewards have improved this. Generally I would describe this, personlly, as a perfect game. I have introduced new people to it, and they have all said similar things, ""I have to get this."" It may not be everybodies vup of tea, but I think it is an amazing game, and worth every penny.",10,XBOX 360
"This game is definitely better than the original Borderlands in terms of interface and how it looks and how it works. And I definitely like the new characters, but I think I'll be missing Mordecai as a playable character. There are more guns, better graphics, addicting gameplay and fantastic voice acting. It is definitely funnier than the original, thanks mostly to Handsome Jack and Claptrap, but in general, it has improved by far from the original.",10,XBOX 360
Borderlands 2 is one of the best sequels in gaming. Everything is sped up and streamlined and faster. The dialogue is wittier and more abundant. The story is the best improvement. It gives you the narrative that original failed to give. Each of the original Vault Hunters makes an appearance in a fantastic fashion. I've only done on play through with the Gunzerker so I can't speak for the other three character classes but I can say my experience with the combat was still awesome and fast paced. It's easy to get lost in the shoot and loot as well as the numerous skills options to customize you character. Overall Borderlands 2 is a highly addicting game and I highly recommend it!,9,XBOX 360
Once in awhile you pick a game up off the shelf and get it home and actually can't stop playing the damn thing :). It makes us all feel good that we have spent our money on a product worth having as well as a company worth supporting. Every other company needs to stop and take a look at how these guys are doing it and reevaluate their development. Love it!,9,XBOX 360
"This is everything that an action game should be. The story is much improved from the last edition, the characters are all great and feel unique, NPC's are cleverly written and help keep the story moving along while the missions are varied enough that you don't feel like you are constantly going to fetch materials or kill a random character. And as much fun as single player is the co-op is where this game truly shines. I haven't had this much fun blasting through bad guys with my brother and a couple of friends in a long time, if ever. With the amount of customization in the characters you really feel like you are working together as a team with your weaknesses being covered by your teammate's strengths. If you are a fan of action games you definitely need to check this one out, it's a blast!",10,XBOX 360
"Quite possibly one of the funnest games of the years. There's a lot from borderlands that has been mostly unaltered in the sequel. Thankfully though, they've improved on enough, and added just enough to make this a worthy purchase. The gameplay itself is mostly unchanged, save for a few additions. The shooting is frantic and fast passed alone, but throw 3 other players into the fold, and enjoy as pure chaos ensues. The 4, soon to be 5, different character classes all play well with each other strengths, and the skill trees have been reworked to give much greater customization. Borderland's 'Bazillion' of guns are even 'Bazillionder', as the box says, with the inclusion of a new element 'slag'. The variety of grenades, shields, class mods, ect. have all been greatly improved on as well. The story in the first Borderlands was almost completely forgettable, but it has received a lot more work this time around. Well written and humorous, the cast of bizarre characters and settings offers a quirky, interesting story throughout. The side quests may get dry from time to time, but the excellent voice work and unique characters will keep you listening to every line of dialog regardless. In terms of pure quality, the graphics are fairly lacking. However, the insane, cell shaded style keep it a pleasure to look at, and the chaos during battles offer plenty of eye candy. Get enough chaos going at one time however, and there will be some drop in the frame rate. This doesn't happen too often though, and isn't always too consequential. Borderlands 2 is definitely an worthy purchase, and with at least 4 more dlc packs on the way, I look forward to playing this game for a good long while. If you haven't yet gotten your hands on this game yet, I would strongly recommend it.",10,XBOX 360
"A gaming masterpiece. It's everything you could want in a video game, without spreading itself too thin. While it isn't absolutely perfect, Borderlands 2 exceeds any standard that could be set for a video game. It has a good story with highly memorable characters, including one that so few games get right: a believable antagonist. Great graphical style and visual effects (especially on the PC), insanely entertaining, maximum replayability, and absolutely hilarious. Let's list all the pros and cons. ** Pros ** ++ Good story ++ Motivated protagonists and antagonist ++ Never have an identical experience ++ Awesome graphics ++ Liquid-smooth gameplay ++ 25-plus hours of play for the first playthrough (and there is a second one that takes longer) ++ Varied missions ++ Most hilarious video game of this console generation ++ Over twenty million guns - well over, I believe ++ One of the best co-op games ever made ++ Highly moddable for those familiar with .ini files (PC only) ** Cons ** -- Under-utilized vehicle system -- Odd inventory interface (PC only) -- The difficulty of missions is not indicated clearly (some are unreasonably difficult even when the quest tracker says ""difficulty: normal"")",10,XBOX 360
"Game is great, it has really **** me in. Wasn't so thrilled with the tutorial part at the beginning as it really has a super slow pace. I hope it is skippable on my second play through as I would hate to have to repeat it. Overall I'm really pleased with the game.",9,XBOX 360
"I've been playing this game for about 15 hours or so now and I'm loving every new area, enemy and gun as much as the first. Simply put, if you like FPS games you have to get this. The single players is excellent and the co-op is the best I've played since GRAW & Rainbow six Vegas. Normally I can't be bothered to collect everything but I find myself searching every nook to get ammo, money, eridium and guns. The guns all have a different feel and their own uses which means your selection is very important in battles. There is enough customization to keep you happy and the characters you meet have a personality of their own and sometimes a nice gun for you. Humour? it's got a lot and as for fun, there is nothing better than letting a midget run at you with your sniper sights trained on his head, then at the last minute....BOOM! I was looking forward to BLOPS 2 and Halo 4 but they will need to be something special to beat this game. I also normally trade games in as soon as I've finished the single player and played a couple of months of multiplayer but I will be keeping this game to play the DLC missions and characters. Awesome game and massive fun.",9,XBOX 360
"Spectacular game. Do as many of the side missions as possible. They are hilarious and sometimes both challenging and hilarious. It's spectacular. Everything from Borderlands 1 that made it amazing are here and improved 10 fold. I've never had so much fun finding new guns in a video game ever. It's like finding new blades in any given RPG, only these go boom.",10,XBOX 360
"This is a great game and a huge improvement over the original borderlands. Don't listen to the 3-5 hour in reviews, the quests and enemies get better as you go",10,XBOX 360
"I bought into the hype and purchased this on day one. I played it in co-op but this game was a big let down. It's more of the same, which your opinion will differ on that depending on how much you liked the first game. I did play and beat the first one so I knew what to expect. If you loved Borderlands you more than likely bought and finished it already. But if you're on the fence I'd say buy it only if you'll play with two or three friends. If you can, wait a year until the edition with all the DLC comes out so you don't waste money. Don't get it if you're going to play alone.",7,XBOX 360
"Improves on the first game in almost every way imaginable. Borderlands 2 is winner and starts off the fall season of triple A titles. Unless you're going through a very excessive playthrough it's near impossible to run out of things to do. Side missions continually pop up and are always a joy to run through, earning you more guns, supplies, and various loot. The games all about the loot, no two items are ever the same thanks to a new randomly generating loot and gun system, and the variety in weapons is at the top of the mountain; no other game comes near it. It's graphically appealing and prettier this time around. Environments are much more luscious and varied than it's predecessor. My only complaints are that the story is often predictable yet very enjoyable, and some missions get tedious as there's much backtracking to be done. Overall though Borderlands 2 is a must own for any gamer, it has the best of everything, great RPG elements, it's a solid FPS, and the game is hysterical.",9,XBOX 360
"Amazing game, I enjoyed Borderlands 1 but number 2 is a giant leap ahead. Great story and awesome game play. I don't understand the negative comments. Nothing wrong with this game!",10,XBOX 360
"neilsmif1980 is clearly a troll, since borderlands has an autosave that would prevent ""starting from the beginning like he claims this bug did"" so grats, troll was trolling. Anyway, the game is awesome, improved gameplay and co-op from the first (split-screen co-op woot woot). If you liked the original there's no way you don't like this",10,XBOX 360
"This isn't the perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it does have enough charm and versatility to justify the label of a ""good game"". However, the worrying trend of blockbuster releases receiving perfect 10/10 scores from major critics rears it's ugly head again - making it difficult to take certain review sites seriously. That said, the game improves on it's predecessor in the key area of gameplay, even if it isn't as immersive as the original is in terms of character and quirkiness. The RPG elements are ""OK"" - it struggles to remain coherent as it deals with an absurd storyline (but then, the original wasn't exactly **** in narrative either!) - but if you strip away the glitz and graphical glamour of this title, you're left with a by the books shooter at the end of the day. ITo be blunt, if you're buying this hoping to have an RPG experience, you'll end up losing interest in the lacklustre story and you'll be simply shooting whatever moves before long. The reason this game is worth a purchase, even when taking on board the crowded market it exists in, is because the multiplayer is very good, and the humour is pretty unique in this genre - something missing since the demise of Duke Nukem as a credible franchise.",7,XBOX 360
"Finally a game this year actually worth spending the time to play. This year has been struggling so far. If you remotely liked the first BL, you will LOVE this one. SO FUNNY and addicting.... even my wife is laughing because of the dialogue and she hates watching me play.",10,XBOX 360
"Co-op experiences do not get any better than this folks, Borderlands 2 is a fun and cool game, it's as simple as that, it doesn't have a deep story or deep characters but it sets out to make you laugh and enjoy yourself and it accomplishes just that, hats off to Gearbox.",9,XBOX 360
The Best advice I can give you people interested in the game is buy it NOW! Why should you buy it now? well the critics love it that should be a good enough indicator.,10,XBOX 360
"I missed all of the press / advertisements of the first game and had it recommended to me from a friend. Once I picked it up, I fell in love with the game....sure it had its quirks but I enjoyed it immensely. I would give Borderlands 1 a 8.5 or 9, so with that in mind I can't understand how some people who loved the first game, or gave it a high score and either gave it a worse or even review compared to the 1st Borderlands. This game improves upon every single area that I had gripes with in the first one, I love the sound from the vehicles, I love the differences between the gun manufacturers, I am lvl 18 currently and there are people whom I've seen that are a much lower than myself that have weapons with a certain style that I haven't ever seen before at all, which I thing is wonderful. The most impressive thing, is that this game is HARD. I could play the first game with maybe dying 3-5 times through the main storyline....I think I've died 3-5 times at the character selection screen. Some may not like it, but I find it so refreshing. Best game I've ever played",10,XBOX 360
"MUCH better than Borderlands 1 (which is a great game)... I've only played for about 3 1/2 hours but I can tell you the game runs smooth with great graphics, great gameplay, and really good voice acting.",10,XBOX 360
"Great game. Took everything that was strong in the first game and refined areas that needed improvement. It's a beautiful game too. The graphics are beautiful. I don't know what this type of animation is but it looks good. Great color. The sound design is great. Story. Weapons. Levelling up. I think you have to understand that its not a super linear, you have to go this way now, now you have to go that way, you cant go back there because you've already been there type game. It's open world demands some exploration. You're always looking for cash and ""loot"" (ammo, grenades, more weapons, shields, etc). That can feel slow, kind of like RPG's can be sometimes. It's a solid, polished, massive game. Too many positive things to list. Out of a hundred games there are usually only a few that are the ""stand outs"" this is one of them. I've read some critiques that suggest it's too much like the last game. I guess they should have skipped this one and waited for the ""next"" Call of Duty, because those are always different from its predecessor right? I'm enjoying the game, I think you will to.",9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 feels exactly the way a sequel should - lots of little improvements, not too many big changes, and the sense that the baton was simply passed from the original to the successor. I played the first game for over 1,000 hours, completing both playthroughs on all 4 characters and most of the challenges as well. Even just 10 hours into my BL2 playtime, I'm still remarking at each new discovery ""that's EXACTLY what I was missing in the first game"". Improved game mechanics, better use of challenges & goals, easier progression - it's all exactly what Dr. Zed ordered. You SHOULD ABSOLUTELY buy this game and not stop playing it for any reason...",10,XBOX 360
"Incredible game. Everything is upgraded and smoother. My only nitpick so far is ladders, frustrating. Kudos to all involved for a great game. Keep iot up.",9,XBOX 360
"With all the improvements of the game that solved all of the issues I had with Borderlands 1, and considering that this game is not certaintly a recycled copy of the previous title unlike most other titles (*cough* MW3 *cough*), so I was initially pleased that this game was a more give than take kind of game, and It truly is: More skills are more unique to each class (and more beneficial), the badass rank pertains to EACH USER, and not each player, which is worthwhile for any class you make, as well as the challenges you get. The minimap is a lot more helpful in locating your waypoint, enemies and shops, and more rpg elements have been added to the limited RPG element of this RPS game from the previous title. This is one of the few Sequels that actually pertains to making it worthwhile in almost every aspect, almost, that is. There are some issues I have with this game, pertaining to the new graphics engine introduced in the game. While they have solved the issue with the pickup of items crowding the space on your field of view, the whole graphics engine feels quite too clumped with even more enemies, effects and objects. Although, this is a good and bad thing, and can be resolved if your eyesight can manage the over-the-top violence. But, the new menu system is an improvement from borderlands 1 especially with the split-screen play, but the gun stats will constantly get in the way of how much ammo you have, so you have to constantly screen your eyesight quickly enough to get a gist of the ammo you have. And, the ammo. Not to say this a problem, it is an improvement over how much you can get and how much is available, but I still have a problem with identfiying what ammo pack resolves to which. the ammunition in Borderlands 1 was much easier to identify, but nonetheless it isn't much of a big issue. The big new addition to borderlands is the favorites/trash option, which allows you to easily identify which guns you can use, and which guns you don't want. also, you can sell all items that you've identified as trash, which is really innovative considering the time it would take to sell each item individually. Eridium is a cool innovation, and has improved how easy it would take for you to allocate all the Ammo SDU's/Backpack SDU's, and is also important for the storyline. Borderlands 2 also takes some cues from their previous expansion packs, which also brakes away from the tedium that is Borderlands 1. Also, waypoints to locations you need to go will also show on the fast travel network, which is also a plus. Skill COMS will show additions to skills you need, rather than having to remember from scrolling between inventory and skill set in Borderlands 1. Money has been toned down to become more necessary and not as infinite as in Borderlands 1, and you pick up money and ammo automatically when dropped from creeps. You can find personal customization items for your character and your vehicles, as well as plenty of them being available at the start of the game (also, you can get a custom item from having played borderlands 1!). Most importantly, the open-world has been more opened from borderlands 1, with more vibrant, unique and dynamic landscapes with some more worthwhile bossfights and storylines, not to mention the easter eggs. This really helps, considering the side missions in borderlands 1 were like the generic cliche MMORPG-esque missions and the world was more like a snake trail with huge bulges in between. Overall, Borderlands 2 has some few issues that can be easily ignored by all the improvements and the greatly overall better effort produced by Gearbox, and I'm proud to say that this game was worth the money I got, considering I got a lot of bonus coupons off on it!",8,XBOX 360
So far (7 hours in) I can say this is everything I loved from the first installment with a few new tricks all wrapped up in a shiny new package. There are some issues with texture pop in on occasion and getting stuck in the environment. But these are far outweighed by the greatness of the overall experience of this amazing game!,9,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is a great game. It is much prettier, funnier, and it is also more fun than the first game. I really liked Borderlands 1, and it was even more fun when playing with a friend. However, I have only played the second entry in the franchise by myself so far, and it is still more fun than co-op in the first game. I can't wait to play it with friends. There is a lot more variety regarding weapons, enemies, and locales. The first game was desert, desert, and more desert. Borderlands 2, however, starts off on a snowy glacier, and changes up the sites often enough to keep things feeling fresh and interesting. I was actually worried that the game would not live up to my hopes, but it really has. Great purchase, was not expecting to give it a 10. Just a side note, there is no day one dlc, but if you pre-ordered, you get the Mechromancer class for free when it comes out on I believe October 18, but you will not get early access. Also, if you pre-ordered and got the golden key for the rare random weapon chest, I would suggest saving it until you are a very high level to get the most out of it. And last thing, I found that removing the auto-aim option really made the gameplay exciting, it becomes too repetitive when you can just press the trigger to automatically aim at a target (in my opinion anyway). Overall great purchase!",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 Is totally a game of the year contender.This game has so many improvemennts over the first Bordlands,with it's Awesome graphics,story and lets not forget the Funny adult Humor that the series is known for.also the amount of weapons in Borderlands 2 is mind blowing.Borderlands 2 is awesome just like the first Borderlands was as well.A must buy.this Game get's a perfect 10 from me.",10,XBOX 360
"Definitely the best gaming experience to come out so far in 2012. Many improvements over the previous game, and runs beautifully. I highly recommend this game.",10,XBOX 360
"I was an avid Borderlands player, beat it Legitimately, quite a few times. After playing it over and over I was one who ended up modding backpack etc just so I would have storage, even made guns that were pretty legit as well. Why because there were elements in the first one missing. So When i herd they were releasing a sequel I was excited and kept close watch on the subject. Now I didn't get to pre order or anything like that I just went and bought the game Yesterday which was the 18th of September, also the US Release Date. I was very pleased with the graphics and feel of the game much more ""Open Space"" like promised. The one thing that got me was the so called millions of guns and customizations. Someone correct me if im wrong and that wasn't said. And or Im not far enough along yet. I haven't seen many guns and when playing with other players there instantly picked up. I do wish there was set loot for your guy and not just an all out button mash extravaganza to get everything that drops. All in all so far an amazing game I gave it an 8 cause im still not to happy about the gun customization.",8,XBOX 360
"I just need to score this game to level out the number of poor reviews. This game is incredible and anyone who scores this less then an 8 doesn't know fun when it shoots a hole through there face. An absolute must by! By the way, this game contains one of the greatest intro videos of all time.",10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is nothing short of a fantastic game, below you will see the good and bad of the game. The good: -Borderlands 2 graphics are fun to look at and beautiful. -You're put into the action right away. -The game-play is fun and challenging -The writing is hysterical and extremely well done. -Loading times are fast -Each character feels unique and the talent trees are very well done. -Every mission feels like it is important in some way, there are few tedious quests. -More guns -Plenty of character customization -Clap-trap -The bad-ass ranking is a nice replacement to proficiecies -Co-op local and on-line is fun -Although the re-spawn animation is a cinematic, it moves along so fast that it is hardly noticeable -Seeing many familiar faces(and fighting along-side some of them) is a nice way to connect the two games while still keeping it fresh The bad: -There a couple missions that you must run all the way around the map, through enemies much lower leveled than you, that can be annoying -A couple small technical glitches(i feel through one of the boats) -The inventory is very limited and you'll need to drop quite a few guns before you finally get to a bank -There are some difficulty spikes a bit through-out the game, but these really only lead to more trips to the new-u station and a little less money in your pocket While the is not perfect by any means, but it gives the player one hell of a ride and i have to say, i can't wait for the dlc for this game",10,XBOX 360
"I loved Borderlands 1 and spent at least 150 hours playing it, mainly single player and some recently with friends. So this review is through those eyes. This game is everything Borderlands was plus more. The world is detailed and the NPC interaction and movement is way better really giving life to the world and story. I have seen a lot more creative quests than in the first one and each gun manufacturer and type feel a lot different.. The writing is funny and even the enemy movement is funny and awesome. I cannot help but smile while I am playing it because it is so much fun, I cannot wait to dump 200+ hours in this game in single player and with friends. If you want to knitpick about graphic popins and crap you can probably find things but this is a world to be explored, loot to be tried and sold and hilarity around every corner, There is no perfect game but this one is well worth the $60 over and over and easily my most favorite game ever. so screw you it is a 10!",10,XBOX 360
"There isn't much to say about this game. It is truly fantastic and improves on the original in every way. Any fan of the original would be doing themselves a great disservice if they chose not to play this game. Actually, the same goes for any gamer. Play this game.",10,XBOX 360
"The first question people will likely ask is, ""Does this game live up to BL1 and DLC?"" and that answer is a resounding ""Yes!"" The second question, ""Is it better than BL1?"" and the answer is ""**** the most part."" So what's improved? Better gun mechanics (sound and feel), more humor, more frequent boss and sub-boss battles, easier to get a co-op game going and see who's online playing, character skill trees are improved, friends can select quests in co-op games rather than having to tell the ""party leader"" to do it, the new enemies are well designed, you can now dismember baddies, you can now tag items in your inventory as ""trash"" or ""favorite"" so you remember what to sell next time at the vending machine, you can now directly trade with people, you automatically pick up money and ammo (but thankfully not loot) and combat is more organic (enemies take cover, flank you, dodge attacks). So what's the negatives? The new menus are clunky and difficult to parse, missions still consist of mostly ""shoot that"" or ""find this,"" driving mechanics are about the same (though thankfully you don't take damage from hitting enemies as much), level design can be really confusing at times even with the new HUD mini map and sometimes there's simply too much dialogue happening simultaneously. For example if you're playing co-op the first big town you get to is a total cluster as multiple characters are introducing themselves cutting off the others dialogue. I find myself saying, ""what is going on?"" much more regularly during this game than BL1. That said, these are only minor complaints and the additions far outweigh the handful of small issues. In short, if you loved the first BL stop reading this review and go pick up the sequel!.",9,XBOX 360
"If you had any reservations that this sequel would not live up to the predecessor than don't worry ... this game is improved in both game-play/weapons/abilities and also story. Having loved my previous trip to Pandora I was excited to return and this game improves upon what they built last time, one of the best Co-Op games of all time. To play this game by yourself is fun but it also takes away from the heart and soul of this game which is running around with your friends and looting, exploring and raiding the lands of Pandora. Truly a great game by Gearbox and a AAA franchise up there with the other elite titles out there today.",9,XBOX 360
"Probably one of the best games i have ever played. Loot heavy isnt the word for it , and the guns you get are CRAZY cool looking. The special effect of the weapons ever even cooler ranging from a pistol that shoots sticky like explosives to a grenade upgrade that when thrown it slits into 5, 500 plus grenades. Only thing stopping me from giving it a ten is i wish they gave you more creative control over the characters. You do get to change there heads and outfits but obtaining certain items in game but id rather full control , other then that , perfect game . ( lets just hope the ending is better in this then in the first )",9,XBOX 360
"Great game! Everything from the first game has been significantly improved, and new exciting features have been added as well! The campaign is simply epic and even better with a friend.",10,XBOX 360
"After spending an evening with Borderlands 2,I can feel confident enough to make a fair assessment of this game. Borderlands 1 encapsulated me; it look over my life and had me to where I wanted to do nothing but loot skag poo and treasures chests for golden loot. Borderlands 2 is still basically the same game, but involves a more complex leveling up system and ""Eridium"", Pandora's new-found element needed to carry more ammo, more backpack slots, and all that crap. I still enjoy this game, but it really just doesn't capture me as much as the first one. I absolutely DESPISE Zero's power as well; completely useless!",8,XBOX 360
"Outstanding game, it really improves upon the first game. In all areas, large or small, this is a truly superior game. Not to badmouth the very good original game.",10,XBOX 360
this game is one for the fans it keeps the feel of the original and adds a whole lot. there is more humor blood gore and a whole lot of loot to be had in the believable world of pandora. other reviewers have complained about texture pop in but i installed the game and have noticed pop in only once in about 5 hours of game time. this game is truly a master piece.,10,XBOX 360
"Borderlands 2 is definitely a step up from the original. Without a doubt it is my personal favorite game I have played in my entire lifetime. While there is not a ton new features, and there definitely is many of them, it has at least triple of everything good that was in Borderlands. And do not read any of those negative reviews. Those are by Call of Duty fans that do not know what a real video game is.",10,XBOX 360
"Not many games learn from their mistakes, this one does, and does an excellent job at it, an improvement in almost every way, definitely worth getting if you didn't like the first one, and an even better choice if you liked the first one!",10,XBOX 360
borderlands 2 is a amazing game that truly keeps me entertained. I cant stop playing this game because I love it so much if I had to be reborn I would want to be bord in this sick game.,10,XBOX 360
"Brilliant!Far superior in every way than its predecessor,though vehicles remain under **** narrative is so much better this time around that I rarely felt lonesome during solo **** writing is superb and consistently laugh out loud funny and even occasionally surprisingly touching.Whilst the games major claim to fame is the millions(sorry,Bazillions) of guns,once again 99% are useless,which is unfortunately expected and necessary in this type of looter,so I can't complain **** also makes that one great weapon find so so **** four(soon to be five) classes with their various skins and Abilities are great,though ZerO and Axton are much better for solo play,but that could well be because of my particular playstyle.Nevertheless,especially since its it been a quiet year for decent games,this is a must have title.",10,XBOX 360
"Pretty great with bros. The setting and characters are much better this round. The gameplay is LOADS better, with all that indepth customization and stuff.",9,XBOX 360
"MUCH better than Borderlands 1 (which is a great game)... I've only played for about 3 1/2 hours but I can tell you the game runs smooth with great graphics, great gameplay, and really good voice acting.",10,XBOX 360
"borderlands 2 is published by 2k games and developed by gearbox. one thing im specially told about this game borderlands 2 is awesome. borderlands 2 start with a great hand down cinematic story.Characters from the previous game initiate events that cause the planet to spit out precious minerals. Like any good **** most significant change Borderlands 2 can boast over its predecessor is a cohesive plot that actually hangs together reasonably well and drives the story missions forward at a decent **** other big change in Borderlands 2 comes in the game's playable class structure. The melee-enhanced Berserker has been replaced this time around by a ""Gunzerker"" class that can briefly dual wield any two weapons, making for some enjoyably over the top combinations (I particularly enjoyed simultaneously using a shotgun in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other, which I can't recall ever doing in a first-person shooter). I also enjoyed the new Assassin class, which comes with the extremely useful ability to escape with the aid of a temporary decoy, and can use skill tree upgrades that make him a quality melee attacker. noow the time to tell something about graphics last borderlands using cell shaded engine which mean everything like cartoonist now the game using unreal engine 3.every thing in the game is design very well and work on more then 60 frame per second on xbox 360 and normal **** u like the review plz comment about this review thanks.",10,XBOX 360
"Another amazing game in a truly outstanding series, borderlands 2 keeps the familiarity, gameplay and humour of the first game, but it improves on everything. An awesome narrative with some of the most creative and best writing iv'e seen in a video game, filled with the great borderlands humour that we have all grow to love. For a modern shooter it really stands out from the crown with solid and enjoyable mechanics, along with unique the shoot-n-loot mechanic, which has also been vastly improved since the last game, also the skill tree's vary much more, allowing three unique paths for each character. There is no doubt that playing it solo is a great time, but this game truly shines when playing with friends, the co-op experience is no doubt the best iv'e ever had. There is absolutely nothing to complain about when it comes to this game, it achieves everything it has set out to do and improved on it in almost every way since borderlands 1. it is a great game, made by gamers, for gamers, which is why it deserves a perfect 10/10",10,XBOX 360
"I loved Borderlands and all the expansion packs. The game had soul, and freedom of exploration without getting lost and frustrated. It was beautiful, like a backwoods, back yard tin can shoot with a banjo playing in the background. Borderlands 2 traded in the banjo for a slick new look, and an electric guitar. The new Borderlands is a fun game, but it is far from what it could have been. Much like a glamorous action movie without character development, this one drops you into the action in such a way that if you look away from the action and the effects for even a moment, you will see that Borderlands has gone from a rich culture of trash and charm, to a wasteland with nothing but guns for their own sake.",7,XBOX 360
"The Best walking dead game that I have ever played a 10/10 a mast play it has amazing gameplay, great story",10,XBOX 360
"Pros funny glitches lots of guns lots of blood decent idea Negatives Bland design Awful visuals boring ""jump scares"" overpriced",5,XBOX 360

"I don't review games normally, but the other reviews are overly negative, of course its not a replacement for other zombie games like Left 4 dead, its more like a game to be simple and fun unlike so many games that talk about story and such. This is wholely a fun only zone, it does not even matter they are zombies its just fun, its calm. Like Minecraft.",8,XBOX 360
How did this game ever get approval for release? The walking dead franchise is a guaranteed money maker and this is what the give as a product? The game completely fails in every aspect. I did find some fun in the actual zombie killing and the expansion of the overall walking dead world. It just did not hold up to the quality expectation of the Walking Dead IP.,4,XBOX 360
"This game is a must for a walking dead TV fan, it had all the atmosphere that it needs.ThiS GAME IS SO AWESOME!Yes I can understand why people would not like this **** this isnt COD zombies. You actually have to try and survive by trying to hit the head, use stealth and destrations. I think it is a Awsome",10,XBOX 360
"It's not terrible. I wouldn't say ""good"" per se, but it's perfectly.... adequate. It's enormously repetitive, but the core functions work. Everything is just a bit jank, the animations are clunky and the plot and characters are paper thin, but a once through should keep you engaged and not particularly frustrated if you're just looking for something to do. More of an arcade experience for a once through for people who like the show more than anything.",6,XBOX 360
"What the **** where they doing while development, where they just ****ing around while they were developing the game. Not only is this game **** it is a special type of **** the kind that just makes you feel odd on the inside. What were they thinking by releasing this game? I just can't believe how a critically acclaimed tv series got a crappy game. Even though I don't watch the show.",0,XBOX 360
"The biggest problem with this game is that I purchased it for $50. I saw it in stores and I just bought it. BAD MOVE. I should have checked the reviews. At most this game should be $10. Graphics were not great or good, but they are not horrible. This is a good game as long as you are not expecting fantastic. Considering I love the Walking Dead series I was expecting a little more than I got. The plot and storyline were just blah.",4,XBOX 360
"This game entises the player in with the dramatic poster and the iconic characters, but don't be fooled, it's not as good as you think. Yes it has some of the characters from the hit tv series but that doesn't make it good. The story is alright and the graphics aren't to bad. The game is to hard, i am an experienced gamer and I do get its a zombie game, but normally you find yourself in a massive hoard only having a small amount of ammo on your guns! Honestly I believe that they've tried but failed, if you would like a true walking dead game I would buy the tell tale series. It will probably cost mor money, and it's not a first person shooter but the storyline is much better, and you can't really fail, or if you do fail then you can have another chance as its a choice game.",5,XBOX 360

terminal reality gave us a good ghostbusters game back in 2010 a game which i enjoyed but with that game they proved they could treat a good license with respect. with this game they just pissed on the license. with clunky combat a bad story and a terrible ending to that bad story and bad graphics this one isn't worth your time or money. and the A.I. **** donkey crap.,3,XBOX 360

"I will start by saying ""I love the walking dead series""!! Maybe this is why i am rating this game so low.. oh no it is because this game has no merit what so ever.

"A translation of... ""AREALGAMER, Mar 23, 2013... review. For those who could not understand it. I would like to severely differ with the opinions of a majority of these good folk. I am a fan of the ‘Walking Dead’ television series and found this game to be astonishing. It was violent, stealthy and quite action packed (I particularly enjoyed the crossbow). At times whilst frolicking through this virtual adventure I became so engrossed that I felt as though I now existed as the ‘Daryl’ protagonist, skulking through the dim, zombie infested apothecary searching for ‘Marls’ medicine, carrying a flashlight and crossbow and causing various mayhem. With my ‘Turtle Beach’ headphones turned up quite high and myself quite high also, playing in the dark (and I’d like to strongly stress the next points) I found to be quite unnerving and yet amusing. I thought this game portrayed a great tale and exposed us to the omitted link in the ‘Walking Dead’ story. And may I call attention, to all the good folk that dare to decide to have an opinion that differs to my own, that the graphics are on par with some other titles in the marketplace that I’ve seen, so I disagree with any argument to that nature. Honestly, you are all such uncouth savages it’s unbecoming of me to attempt to enlighten you. One last point, I also think consoles are the superior gaming devices. (It's midnight and I was bored so I thought it would be fun to translate a poorly written review, if this somehow offends anyone then bugger off and get some real problems.)",10,XBOX 360
"I was really getting into the L4D series and was revisiting it. I started checking around for zombie games and ran across this. I really enjoyed the title and was surprised to see the very bad reviews it is getting. Yes true, it is sort of a throwback to older games but I liked that about the game and also liked the stealth gameplay idea since you wouldn't want to draw in the attention of hordes of zombies. Nice change-up from a run of the mill FPS that shows they put some thought into the gameplay. Not a bad game, and it will definitely get me into Season 4 of the TV show, which I hadn't previously watched.",10,XBOX 360
Absolutely horrible. I wish I never bought this game. Save your money. The only good part is the actors voice-overs. I got it to have a TWD weekend starting with playing the game and then watching the return of the show on Feb 9th. I played the game for one hour and couldn't stand it anymore. It's in the box on the shelf never to be seen again. Thanks for ruining a fun weekend Activision.,1,XBOX 360
"Why the flying f**k was this game made?! I mean seriously I was disappointed, my world with Lee and Clementine is sooooo much more interesting than this steaming pile of crap. The only thing I liked about this game is that later on you get to use THE GODDAMN CROSSBOW! Which is a show iconic weapon... I feel a bit bad for the actors who decided to stay in this ah well but at least they were interesting and did rather good in their part of the game. And whoever gives this a 10 I will hunt you down and do what I did to Larry. I'm Kenny from the walking dead and I review to save lives.",1,XBOX 360
AWFUL!!! Quite possibly the worst game I have played on this console generation. A cash in money grab by Activision to take advantage of fans. I love the walking dead and loved telltales version go buy that not this it's cheaper and more fun and will not make you want to kill yourself. Beware the 10/10 reviews they mostly only have that one review on their account hello Activision staff we are not as stupid as you like to think. Personally I would find a real zombie apocalypse a lot less distressing than playing this game. The only reason it get's a 1 is due to the fact they released a game that sort of works all though I wish they had not and would have not had to suffer through it. You get the feeling it was rushed and no one gave a toss it was just a scam to separate you from your hard earned cash. The good- Errr it is short so you don't suffer any longer than necessary The bad- A toss up between the awful combat awful look of the game. The ugly- How can you not program zombie A.I? Please tell me Verdict: 1/10 YOU FAIL IT!!,1,XBOX 360
"Nothing more then your average money grab by activation. Poorly executed and rusted, although the game still provides entertainment it's just missing a true story which could of been a masterpiece. Its a shame this happened to such a well known franchise name, looks like another missed opportunity. Would not recommended unless your looking to blow cash or your a serious WD freak.",4,XBOX 360
"This game is a very big deception to the AMC TV show TWD. I love the series but the game is worse that I thought. The story is monotone, the sceneries are always the same as well as the zombies appearance. The graphics and the movements are very limited as well as the gameplay. In this game you don't have an emotion and a connection with your ""partners"", you can treat them as dolls. The only positive point is: you play with Daryl.",2,XBOX 360
"There are some good things about this game, but they are countered by the many things wrong with this poor excuse for a licensed video game. The graphics are textureless, the story is dull and lacking (especially for walking dead) voice acting is awful, and most of all... there is no replay values. This game could have been soooo much more.",2,XBOX 360
"The Story The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts brings you into an apocalyptic world where zombies roam the world.

In Survival Instincts, the story line gives general players and fans of The Walking Dead and insight look of how Daryl, and his brother Merle Dixon, met up with the main group and what they went through before that time occurred as well as show how Daryl achieved his ever-so famous crossbow. The Graphics Graphics quality in Survival Instincts somewhat lacks a dynamic punch, for example a walkers, otherwise known as a zombie, hair looks like it was made of glue or clay then molded onto the head. However, the diversity of each walkers face has it's own unique pattern of bite marks, scratches, shapes of the jaw, teeth and more, these all add to a good fright factor at the right moment of time e.g in a dark room, turning round and a walker attacks you out of no where. There are a great amount of bugs relating to graphics, such as broken fence pieces still floating midair, gates flashing black when opened, walkers floating when killed. All around missions have invisible walls, preventing you from going further away from the current map without any sort of police barricade, for example, taking away a bit of the realistic touch. The Mechanics and sound The AI is very sloppy, throughout gameplay I had opened a metal fence and the walkers still attacked the fence, paying no attention to me whatsoever, I then began to kill them one by one. When one walker died another took its place, as if they were lining up to die. The scavenging mechanics allow you to gather survivors and send them out to gather supplies, but the amount of survivors depends on the size of the car you currently have. That said, there are missions that allow you to find car keys to either bigger, or smaller, cars. When sending out survivors to scavenge for supplies, there is always a chance of getting them killed by walkers, depending on what item you give them to defend themselves with as each survivor has their own skill trait such as being good at using blunt weapons. There were countless sound bugs within this game, fences breaking with the sound of wood getting chopped, walkers dying with the sound of a metal fence breaking and more. The game includes a feature where the player can choose a method of travel such as highways, streets and backroads. Depending on what method you choose, one method can either consume less fuel or another method may take a road such as backroads where it consumes a lot of fuel with a high chance of breaking down. If, by chance, your car breaks down or runs out of fuel, a side mission will take place allowing you to scavenge the nearby area for fuel or car hose. The issue with the side missions is that they're very repetitive, as there are about 3-4 different areas. The Gameplay It felt a bit stiff trying to kill walkers, e.g using the sledgehammer was a lot quicker than normal. One thing that gives a good addition to gameplay is sneaking around, trying to sneak past walkers and stealth killing them by sneaking up from behind and executing the stealth kill action. Like any realistic movie or game, gun fire attracts walkers to your location so be sure to only use your gun in dire situations and ammo is scarce to watch out, you don't want to run out of ammo when you desperately need it. If you ever happen to get grabbed by a walker, it activates a grappling mechanic where the player must place the circle onto the walkers head, activate the attack trigger and stab them in the head. This method breaks fighting gameplay by 50% due to the fact after killing the walker that grabbed you, if there is another walker, it will grab you almost instantly after you let go of the previous walker, this allows you to kill over 15 walkers without using any ammo, losing any health and just drains the fun and realism out of the game entirely. On the last mission, near the very end the last thing you did is mount a military vehicles machine gun and kill any incoming zombies, after which it cuts to black screen and goes to the credits, without showing you how exactly Daryl and Merle met the group like the game was purposely made for. Final Verdict The game seems rushed, only to gain quick money. For the price of $49.99 or £31.99 makes the game a complete rip off, due to the lack of effort of the game. I feel the only reason others need to buy this game, is to play as Daryl Dixon and get to see Merle, even though he is barely in the game. A poor effort to a great series that could have become something incredible if more time was put into it.",3,XBOX 360
"This is my review for walking dead: survival instinct SINGLE PLAYER: 4/10. good characters, but very poor storytelling and direction GRAPHICS: 3/10. outdated, awful N64 graphics with loads of glitches SOUND: 5/10. legit voice actors, but poor quality otherwise GAMEPLAY: 3/10. sub par controls, loads of glitches, and poor fighting and mechanics FUN FACTOR: 4/10. as a fan of the show, i was very disappointed with this mediocre attempt at the game. good ideas, but terrible execution. man, i wish this game turned out better. TOTAL: 3/10",3,XBOX 360
Why on earth is this game has low scores It is practically fun and awesome.I will never get It why you guys hate this.I mean this game is better than dead island.,9,XBOX 360
"I am a really big fan of The Walking Dead and this game really pissed me off. The game is short, the game play is repetitive, and Merle is barely in the game! The survivors that you can recruit in your group are useless in this game because when you send them to get supplies, they either come with one piece of food that you have to use on them because they get so up, or they die. And the ending is horrible, even though if one of my favorite levels of the game. I blame Activision",4,XBOX 360
There really isn't much to say about this game apart from the fact that it is just plain awful I will start with the graphics which are a big thing nowadays. Even on the outdated Xbox 360 console the graphics are bad. This game looks like it is from the play station 2 old Xbox era and I have seen better graphics on Xbox live arcade games. But that's not the biggest thing for some people is it so I'll go say how the story is next If your a big fan of the walking dead like me then I beg you dont buy this game and fall into the trap like me and so many others have done. It's obvious this game was just a money grab and from activision that doesnt suprise me. You may be tempted with it having the dixon brothers in it like me and it also having the actual actors from the show for the voice acting but thats no reason to go and blow your hard earned cash on this crap game. The story is sub-par and doesnt do the show or the dixon brothers the credit and justice they deserve You drive around from place to place with the game actually being scripted I kid you not scripted. When travelling from one destination to another if your hear dialog as you do so you will not I repeat will not find any supplies or have the opportunity to scavenge any places The ending was crappy too and was a huge letdown I managed to **** through the game and was looking forward to seeing the ending as I thought that would atleast maybe make up for something but it doesnt This game just screams rushed. The gameplay is also very boring too like the story and the zombies are incredibly stupid too you can at times stand behind one for several seconds and they wont even smell you and turn around The zombies also re spawn too when leaving a area and going back Dont buy this game I would suggest renting it at best,2,XBOX 360
"I like this game, it's not different from any other zombie game apart from the player being Daryl (it's deryl not daryl) but I enjoyed myself. There's not many missions to do at all, and all it consists of is you being abandoned by meryl (once you've found him), running round and collecting supplies and killing around 20 zombies a time. It gets repetitive easily but it kills time. The gameplay is nothing different, and the story is kinda s*it.",5,XBOX 360
"The crossbow was pretty awesome, slegehammer and fire axe was great for hurry situtation, but other melee weapon was so weak. the quest was pretty good and challenging. The most moment's that i hate it was, the breakdown and some scavenged chance that ruined some of the gameplay. The game was great only for recomendation, not to be positive.",5,XBOX 360
"I can see why some people don't like this game but as an earlier reviewer said, it's not cod zombies. I really like the way of sneaking and making choices and it has also got a great replay ability. There are some bugs here and there but if you are willing to look past those bugs, it's a great game. It's also a really ambient game and it sets your mood to actually fear those zombies that are banging on your door. The fact that they have based the characters on the tv series is awesome because I really like the tv series. Overall a great game and a definite buy!",9,XBOX 360
"Is this a prototype? Meh. The AI of the zombies are stupid, Even though guns feel right, everything else doesn't. This is not a survival game this game is meant for the story? Pardon me? The Story is completely A child could of wrote it.. The developers gave the bare minimal effort to create this game, This was only made to get money off of stupid consumers. I mark this as a Scam for the Xbox 360, This was meant for the Playstation 2.",3,XBOX 360
Terrible. It was a good thought for a game but thy should have spent more time with it. Honestly I hated and it was not worth 40 bucks maybe 10 or 15.,1,XBOX 360
"Playing through this game I maid a mental checklist of just about everything a game could do wrong. Walking Dead Survival Instinct hit on all of them. Invisible walls, check. Horrible AI, check. Awful graphics, double check. Unresponsive guns that feel like a toy, check. Non-fluid animations, check. I could keep going but you get the point. This game is an insult to gamers and the people who buy games. This should have been a $10 novelty game and even at that price it would deserve the scores it's getting. The game is absolutely horrible with the only redeeming quality being that it's the only shooter where you can live in the Walking Dead world. The devs and the Activision knew full fell this game would be horrible and they are doing damage control with user reviews. It's actually worse than Alien Colonial Marines which I didn't think was possible. Hands down worst game of the year and it's pushing worst game of the decade I've played. There is absolutely no reason why this game should exist. It's only there to trick gamers who don't follow review scores into thinking it's good because of the name only and to spend their hard earned money on this game (not even sure it should be called a game.) Avoid at all costs unless you want to rent to find out just how bad it is for yourself like I did.",2,XBOX 360
I personally don't understand how negatively this game has been received. It wasn't released as a AAA title and was priced as such. I enjoyed the game from beginning to end. And it's one of the few games I didn't mind going through a second playthrough to finish up the achievements. The bonus relics that unlock items to use from the beginning of your second playthrough are a nice touch. I loved using my silenced pistol and rifle throughout my run to the stadium.,8,XBOX 360
"This game could have been so much more. But it wasn't. When I saw it advertised instead of being excited and interested, I just simply said 'This'll be terrible.' The game itself is broken and the A.I. is that of a wondering sheep in a field.",1,XBOX 360
"One of my favorite TV shows with Merle and Daryl made into a game was a dream come true. But the end result turned out to be a big disappointment. First of all, the graphics are really muddy and outdated when I started up the game. But i was willingly to looked past that to play the game. The game play itself is nothing amazing but sneaking pass zombies and killing them was pretty enjoyable. I found the assassination animation pretty repetitive and it would have been nice if the developers put different animations for different melee weapons Instead of the same old stab in the head with a knife. The story was bad and the ending was even worst. I enjoyed they the option to choose multiple paths which offers replay-ability. The choice to enlist different survivors was a pretty cool idea but they were completely useless and would be best to leave in the car. You can only have a certain number of survivors with you and you would have to leave someone behind if the car got full. I found it off leaving someone behind without a word of complaint. The only good part of the game is probably the appearance of Merle and Daryl but they barely say anything to increase the value of the game. Overall, the game was rushed and a quick cash in and not worth the buy.",4,XBOX 360
"Just another rushed game for a quick buck. Boring and repetitive game-play, boring story line, boring weapons. This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Wait, I'm confused, EA didn't make this?",3,XBOX 360
"I actually enjoyed this game. I do have to retort to the people giving it bad reviews, what were you expecting? The main point of topic is that it has bad graphics which is nonsensical to dock it points for that. The graphics aren't ground braking, but certainly not bad, at times the lighting and shading is epic. The rest of the game is lots of fun. I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes FPS's or zombies, even more so to a walking dead fan. Although I preferred the TellTale games version, this is a good game. Don't let the bad reviews put you off.",9,XBOX 360
"ThiS GAME IS SO AWESOME! The framerate is always 200 fps or something like that, the graphics look better then crysis 3, and the story is so emotional. U NEED TO BUY THIS! This isn't a sandbox game but you will not see a difference. The variety of maps is SO HUGE and SO BIG. U really think ur living in a big city. Also the zombies are SO detailed and the texture quality are SO awesome. At really every chapter I had to cry because the story was SO good. BUY THIS GAME!!! ITs like I bought four games for the very CHEAP price of 50 euro's!!!!!!!!! SO CHEAP!!!!!!!",10,XBOX 360
"I'm glad I borrowed this game instead of buying it. There is some fun to be had, but it gets highly repetitious very quick. As far as I can tell, there are only about 6 different zombie faces, so get used to bashing/shooting the same 6 zombies over and over. My biggest complaint about this game is the auto-save feature. It doesn't save until you actually accomplish part of the quest or a side quest. There's been a couple occasions where I had to replay 15 minutes of the game over because of the auto-save. There are some decent aspects of the game. Deciding which survivors to take with you (although I don't understand the whole having a pickup truck and only being able to choose one **** would think the other survivors wouldn't mind getting in the back of the truck), and choosing which route to take when driving (you choose back roads, street, or **** don't actually ""drive""). Bottom line, if you don't mind mediocre graphics and endless repetition, then you may really enjoy this game. Otherwise, I highly recommend renting or borrowing from a friend.",4,XBOX 360
"The back story to Daryl and Merle... was a FAILURE. No wow factor, nothing in this game will want you to keep playing to the end. It's pretty bad when you care less about the characters as the LEADS in a game as opposed to the TV show where they are not. This game is worth a play at 10 bucks, but anything more and you're just getting ripped off.",2,XBOX 360
"Yes I can understand why people would not like this **** this isnt COD zombies. You actually have to try and survive by trying to hit the head, use stealth and destrations. I think it is a Awsome, and great game and the graphics have a Boderlands 2 feel and the zombies grabing you is pain but other than that i feel like it was almost spot on..feeling of a real zombie Apocalypse",9,XBOX 360
"I don't understand why everyone is giving this game such a terrible review. It is definitely not the best game I've ever played, but I read the reviews and decided to try it out myself. I think the game does have some great elements, the decision making and choosing where to go next is very innovative in a zombie style game. It has times when I jumped because a zombie caught me unexpectedly. This game reminds me of a toned down Dead Island. Is it worth your $50? No, I can say when it gets to $20 bucks or less I would recommend the game to anyone, it is worth that. This game right now is definitely a rental. You will have some good times with it.",7,XBOX 360
Fantastic. A zombie videogame with a new point of view which will make everyone think about the consequences on the society caused by a disaster... I really like it,10,XBOX 360
"I wait something better with this video game, activision disappoint me, Boring game, The walking dead video game is better than this, i expect something better but really disappoint me.",5,XBOX 360
"For a 2013 game, the graphics and gameplay are very dated. Only Telltale has been able to make a good series of games related to the Walking Dead brand. Although years have passed, we still haven't seen a big budget AAA game from this brand. They ruined the game side like the TV series. If the owners of the Walking Dead brand didn't only care about making more and more money without spending money, a game close to Days Gone could have come by now. But after this hour, there's no point anymore. There are too many zombie games on the market. They couldn't use it when they had the opportunity.",4,PC

"I probably seem very strange, but I liked this game, yes, it is not a masterpiece, but it linked me with my atmosphere, I ran away from the walking with such an experienced that they were about to eat me through the screen, of course not very well, but it was the atmosphere that I remembered very well.",7,PC

Good concept very poorly executed. Played this game a couple of times. Well it is kind of short five hours tops and my TWD fan brain overrode the many flaws of this game.

"Zapewne przed rozpoczęciem przygody z najnowszą odsłoną Żywych trupów (jeśli w ogóle się na to odważycie) nasuną się Wam skojarzenia z zeszłoroczną grą od Teltalle Games – The Walking Dead. Zebrała ona świetne recenzje i była jedną z najlepszych produkcji wydanych w 2012 roku. Od razu dodam więc, że obydwie gry, poza nazwą oczywiście – nie mają ze sobą nic wspólnego. The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct jest tylko marną próbą zarobienia na fanach serialu i tematyki zombie. Jedynym plusem jest obecność postaci znanych z serialu oraz to, że możemy usłyszeć dialogi przez nich czytane. Fakt ten sprawił, że nie wyłączyłem gry już po pierwszych 15 minutach… tylko trochę później ;-) Dobrze, że nie miałem co do tej produkcji większych oczekiwań, bo srodze bym się zawiódł. Gracie na własną odpowiedzialność! Pełna recenzja dostępna jest na blogu ****",5,PC
"The game is a rip off! For the price and the name you'd expect more than this game. Even as a fan of the series, it is not worth buying. Do not buy it.",2,PC
"Graphics are stunning, but controls are clunky.",2,PC
"2013 title with game engine from 2004 that was un-optimised for the PC platform the graphical detail would have been fine but hell the performance for that detail was shocking on any machine, The price is way out of what the category of this game is, Interaction and handling probably has something to do with CONSOLIFICATION PORTING etc Bad mess of crap DON'T BUY THIS",1,PC
The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is that game that rips off. it just lying to you making you think that you bought the walking dead seasion 1. this game ****. awful story and the graphics are bad for the wii u and ps3. on pc at least i can see fine. gameplay is so repetitive. one of the worst enemy AI every in gaming. the walking dead season 1 is just at 30$ and it was so much better than this disgusting 50$ generic ass game. that's why there are speed runs for this game on youtube. IN UNDER 45 MINUTES ! 4-5 M-I-N-U-T-E-S,0,PC
"Pretty good game, with some neat mechanics. Not really worth all the bad reviews is gets. The graphics are a bit dated and the game is a bit short and repetitive, but if you sit through and play it, it gets pretty intense during the later stages. You get a good feeling with you draw one walker at a time into your trap and take them out with a hunting knife. Will definitely play through again with the some of the bonuses you get when finishing.",8,PC
"The I.A. is **** stupid, the storyline is a ****, the characters don't even make it to be 2d characters, they're 1d, Daryl and Merle, two of the most loved characters of the show are boring and look like nothing to the TV Show. The only thing that I saw that looked like the TV Show was that if you fired a gun a swarm would pile on you. With all that out of the way, if you're patient, you might have some fun. But only for some hours.",4,PC
"Pros: Great voice acting Motivating music Cons: Old Graphics Broken animations Performance Confusing logics and scripting Artificial Intelligence Small maps Basically lack of entertainment from gameplay It's a rushed cashbrab, not much else to say",2,PC
Honestly do not blame the company they were clearly rushed to push the title out to shelves before the season ended Alot of good ideas poorly executed like having people in your group but only being able to tell them to go look for stuff while you risk your life alone. Do not understand why it was build as 2 brothers surviving together and all u see is merle standing outside the mission zone. The water/food idea good but again poorly executed. Like the scavaging aspect AGAIN POORLY EXECUTED. Found myself running through majority of herds. The ability to choose your route is cool but should have been 2 endings 1for each route u took. BIGGEST GRIPE. You tell me I GET TO BE DARYL which is my favorite and lots of peoples fav. His signature weapon is what? THE CROSSBOW!....When do you get the crossbow....AFTER YOU BEAT THE ENTIRE GAME! Seriously!!! Co-op LESS BUGS and not being rushed so much would have gotten at 6or7 from me for at least trying to give us what you built the game up to be. for now A 5 OUT OF 1O & Lucky for it. Only positive is it is not 2 long has easy achievements for you hunters out there. and you do get some pretty bloody zombie kills and will get ur hands on a somewhat decent variety of melee weapons and slightly less variety of guns. UNTIL OF COURSE YOU BEAT THE GAME. cheap way to get replay value almost brought me to give them a 4 but To be honest a 5 to me means not total garbage & unplayable but not something i'd play multiple times over or recommend to people My youtube has tons of gaming videos some for walking dead to search SAME NAME AS THIS PROFILE thx and xbox live guys add me Bluntz4breakfas,5,PC
"This game was meant for a single purpose. Money. When telltale's game got the game of the year reward, they saw it as a opportunity to earn money, and out came this game. The game has some interesting ideas, but if they took the time to actually make the game good, then this would have been acceptable. 3/10",3,PC
How did I complete this... This I'm sorry to say rubbish. The combat the level design it was rubbish I'm sorry but it's true. The gameplay **** and the graphics looked okay but I could only run it on low. What the heck? I'm sorry but I have to give this a low score. Also i don't have multiplayer. I don't even know if there is any but there might be. But I lost half textures from the game to. Reason it did not download them. Why? Overall -Bad combat -Okay Graphics -Did not install correctly Score 29/100,2,PC

"If you think that the telltale version is similar to this you are very wrong. The game is not worth 50 bucks, that's why i bought it on sale (50%off). The game-play and voice acting are pretty well done. If you are a fan of the walking dead tv series then this is the game for you. You do need some patients for this game though. Over all this was a pretty fun game.",8,PC
A little bit boring. Daryl cannot save the video game. It's very bad and I would rather play an another video game instead of this. Because it's Walking Dead I am rating it with 3. Otherwise I would have rated it with a very big 0!!!!! The **** a word!!!!! Awful!!!,3,PC

"An atrocious game, And possibly one of the worst Ports in video game history. I could only stomach about 40 minutes of this trash until I wanted to throw my mouse at the wall. The graphics look like a Playstation 1 game, the sounds are repetitive and annoying, but the one thing that makes this game total garbage is the horrifying controls, most notably the forced Mouse Acceleration that makes aiming and navigating a complete disaster. Not only does it have the most **** Mouse Acceleration, but the mouse aiming will just glitch out and start sticking on different parts of the screen. An unplayable travesty ****. And to make matters worse, the devs still won't recognize or fix the horrible controls and mouse issues, which shows you how little they care. I couldn't play any more of this if someone was paying me. Stay well away from this abomination.",0,PC
"Maybe this is not a perfect game, but for me personally, it seemed interesting to me. The plot, it is not present, a set of disjointed tasks, after the first mission, you will no longer follow the plot, and in the middle of the game and did you forget what you are doing at a particular location. The gameplay is, to me personally it is not bored and tired, he certainly did not seem to me a very varied but had a couple of evenings. Graphics, as you say in general, the game is similar to the first part of the Diablo drawn in Paint. Yes, maybe the price is too high and, yes can play and raw and made ​​purely for earnings, but nevertheless it can not be called bad, if only because it does not force you to throw chairs at the monitor",6,PC
Bad seriously bad. I'd better play the Left 4 Dead series then this. The A.I is bad the walkers can't even get to a simple gate. The graphics oh my god I'm gonna puke at Activision.,1,PC
"Activision ponownie chciało zarobić na kurze znoszącej złote jaja. Wpakować popularną nazwę i zarabiać miliony, cóż nie zawsze to tak działa. Po pierwsze, słaba grafika, chodź to nawet nie grafika stanowi największego problemu. Strasznie nudny, monotonny, głupi model kampanii. Głupie, niedopracowane elementy survivalowe, bugi, niedopracowania. Już z daleka widać że gra była robiona na szybko. Na szczęście gra jakoś się ratuje. Jest rzeczywiście trudna, postawia na pewne ciekawe elementy survivalowe, i trochę ciekawiej pokazuje zombie niż w wielu innych grach. Moja ocena 5/10",5,PC
a really big shame that they still asks 50$ for this garbage. this game isn't even worth to download for free.. this game was released 22 march.. and still not 1 update to fix the problems.. but i love the tv show,0,PC
"This game was a huge disappointment as I’m such a fan of the Walking Dead series and Norman Reedus, but it’s like TR didn’t even care, the game feels and plays like a pretty good college-project with a Walking Dead theme slapped on it. The basics of the game is you travel from instanced area to area with one main mission with optional side-quests thrown in, allowing you to do things such as change vehicles, get extra supplies, and find other survivors. Vehicles determine how many extra survivors you can have when travelling from one area to the next. At the beginning of each area, you can assign tasks to the survivors such as searching for ammo, finding gas, or finding food (healing). It all sounded so cool and the ideas were there, the lore was there; but the execution was piss poor. The combat gets tired after 15 minutes and the gameplay repetitive, nothing you do or the choices you make really seem of relevance, you don't ever get into the story before it just ends. Pretty bad.",3,PC
"I liked the fact that the voice acting are from the actual characters of the TV show. But the rest of the game is just AWFUL, the game play is just so repetitive, the story is boring, lazy and pointless. The ZOMBIES have a terrible A.I, terrible and insulting ending for the fans of the TV show. Repeating side missions and broken mechanics. Worst game of 2013 so far.",3,PC
"Amazing show, Bad game. Huge let down, this is shovel-ware at its finest. Do yourself a favor and buy Telltales, The Walking Dead, and call it a day.",0,PC
Once again another crapy move/tv licensed game. Have we not learned already about how much these games such. This is such a copy and paste shooter with a weak story line and brain dead AI. The quick time event is so annoying when attacked by a horde. I love the Tv show and I guess that is the only reason to buy this game. Instead get the telltale Walking Dead Game. IT IS AWESOME!,3,PC
"Oh, man.... I'm so glad I pirate games before buying them right now. I've been hearing good things about ""that Walking Dead game"" from co-workers for a while, so I gave it a go. I was coming here to see why on Earth they recommended that to me. (Oops!) I was told of character depth and exploration, as well as meaning in choices not presented in a binary format. For this game, it's quite the opposite. Characters are just ""there."" I guess you are expected to have seen the early part of this series, which I did not (wish I had, because I hear it was even better toward the beginning). There aren't really any meaningful choices in the game which isn't objectively bad, but it doesn't have any character development, either. There aren't many weapons, but there's not an unreasonably limited amount of weapons, which I think would actually be good if the weapons were very different. Unfortunately, a machete pretty much functions the same as a hammer or a sledgehammer, and enemies are all the same, so the weapons' differences (within their own classes [melee, handgun, rifle]) are mostly skin-deep. Melee combat is pretty boring, and I have no idea why auto-aim would be default-enabled on the PC, but melee and ranged combat is fairly well-balanced (that is, the increased power of ranged weapons is often outweighed by the disadvantage of grabbing nearby walkers' attention). There's a ""companion"" kind of system in the game, but nobody ever fights alongside you in-game. There's not really any point to it. Survivors generally require more supplies to heal than they're able to scavenge (none of which I ever ran out of), there's no special reward, and there's no reason at all for them to be in the game, really. Levels are pretty small, and shockingly enough, repeated over and over in scavenge situations. The devs at least made item and enemy placement in SameLevel semi-random. Praise Jesus for the man who implemented that... I would've quit the game early on if I had to go through the exact same scavenge missions. The game devs decided to limit inventory, both in how much you can store on-person, and how much you can store in your car. By doing this, they've effectively limited how many weapons you'll ever use. Find a favorite weapon in each class (I brought the early bolt-action rifle and machete to the end), dump the rest. The game does a good job at getting a few cheap scares in. It's no survival horror, though. There were maybe four or five times it managed to catch me off-guard, and the first few levels gave me the sense of dread. They give you more powerful weapons as you progress and same-strength enemies, so combat ends up very uneven, totally ruining the atmosphere they appeared to be going for. That said, you can just go through the game with a first-level melee weapon without much trouble. I somehow managed to get the game to run at 2x speed (did this when I enabled ""windowed"" mode) on the last three levels and didn't have any problems getting through. It actually made the game feel much more intense. The game is indeed about 5 hours long. There's replay value in that you're forced to choose between ""story"" levels, so you can go back and do the other ones (not that you'd want to). -But really, it's probably the shortest non-indie game I've ever played. With a pretty mediocre graphics engine (or poorly utilized one, perhaps), it's shocking that this game takes up >8gB of storage. I'm not at all sure how they managed that. It's a forgettable, unpolished game with little depth. I'm giving it 3/10, but the game was running at 2x speed through the end level, so all I remember was shooting a bunch of super-fast zombies in the face with a machine gun, which was a pretty decent ending for me!",3,PC
This game is so underrated it's not even funny how underrated it is. The game starts off pretty well right away with 30 zombies that do kill you. that's why I give this game a solid eight.,8,PC
"A game with some nice ideas but the developers totally it up. It's a horrible game with awful graphics and a bad KI. Although i only played the tutorial and the first mission i had to exit the game because it was too awful i would say it's a monotonous and boring game. Some ideas are really nice but the developers did not realise they're on the wrong way. 1 point for some good ideas but the implementation failed. Just a try to make money with the ""Walking Dead"" name. Poor!",1,PC
"Bad game if you really want to play it because you are a fan of the Tv show just watch some gameplay and cutscenes i couldn't bare much and gave in, horrible game....",0,PC
"This game... I have been so excited about it and thought it would be awesome! But it all let me down... This game became a piece of The graphics are on really not that bad but still its so crappy! You will ALWAYS find freaking zombies ignoring you and just hitting the wall or breaking a door even if you are just by them! I would have gave this game atleast a 1 out of 10 if it had CO-OP but no! They said they actually wanted to focus on the STORY! Does this look like a good story for you?! The ending is way worse than the ending of Mass Effect 3! The voice acting is really bad and when you send out a survivor for scavenging for some stuff for you he or she will ALWAYS come back with with a tiny little bit of health! Also they will NEVER EVER get valuable stuff! About of 4 survivors you sent will get you about 2 or 1 piece of gas, food, ammo and weapons! They didn't even try to get the stuff you wanted! And while you fight zombies out there you can have them stay in the car just doing NOTHING! Not even helping you! As a huge fan of the show and the Tell Tale Games' Walking Dead this is a HUGE piece of bull****! This deserves a very bad and stupid 0 OUT OF 10!! I can't give it a higher rating because of all this crap the game has to offer! Everyone who gives this game a rating over 7 is a dumb idiot who doesn't know what TRUE games are! Anyway thanks for thinking that this review is helpful so it can make idiots who love this game BELIEVE that it ****!",0,PC
"I thoroughly enjoyed the game... and VERY RARELY does a single player game grab my attention. I have played through The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct about 5 times now in attempts to save all the necessary survivors. EVERY time I have played through the game.. I have experienced different content (locations) I was not exposed to before... I felt the AI was aptly responsive and worked very well. This is not the Left 4 Dead series... getting hit means soemthing... Stealth is somewhat required. Sure, there could be more graphics tweaks, or coop, or pvp... but the game was just released... who knows what they may have in store later. Until then I found the game stimulating and entertaining all around. I also experienced no glitches or bugs. At the end of the day.. this game was created for hardcore Walking Dead fans... which I am and I love the game. The game could be salvaged from a ""marketing"" standpoint quickly by releasing more meaty content for the game.. and not charging the players for it.",9,PC
"Meh, this game isn't really good, but it's not as bad people are saying it is, I expected this game to be horrible, so I am not disappointed, I would say it's a 5/10",5,PC
"The main reason, and perhaps the only one, that I had to play this game was nothing more than it is a Walking dead game. The graphics looks like the game has 10 years, the playability is not bad, but is not smooth and therefor is not good either. The story is kind of lame and confuse. And I passed it really quick. The thing that it really lacks, and I missed it a lot, was the loot system. It doesn't have one. I wanted to loot everything! But I got nothing. But, it's not everything bad. It requires you to be stealthy because fight more than 2 zombies will get you killed. Which is a good thing. Daryl shows up, as well as Merle, but rare are the times you see Merle. Zombies are dumb, slow, and ugly. But they are not scary. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing. The weapons are cool, probably the best thing in the game, but when you have the really nice ones, where you can kill hordes of zombies, the game ends... Well, I give it a 5 because the game is not that bad. The thing is: It was pretty disappointing. I expected a nice game, playable, looking good and maybe some rpg experience. But instead I got an ugly, hard to play, confuse and too linear.",5,PC
"Total waste of money, $14.99 would have been dead on for this game. Not the 50 you have to lay out. My mistake was not looking into the actual game before purchase. This game is nothing more than a cash cow based on the TV show is all. If you love ""The Walking Dead"" that much buy it but if I were you then please save it until it goes on sale. The graphics system looked like half life 1 gen and the gameplay itself was terrible. (The PC version) Has very little health and ammo powerups unlike from what I've heard on the console that they have tons of health and ammo everywhere. This game completely disappointed me and I wish they would have taken more time to develop it as it could have been something great! But again it's a NAME cash cow game that takes the player by surprise after you buy it. The publisher should have been another warning for me to check into it before purchase as well.",2,PC
This game is... borderline broken... I don't wanna do a review... just don't buy it... please. The only good thing in this is the Voice Acting of some characters. Awful AWFUL AWFUL game.,1,PC
"The Walking Dead is a successful comic that has since been adapted to AMC's hit TV show of the same name. The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct focuses on a character who is exclusive to the TV show called Daryl Dixon and is currently a fan favourite. Daryl Dixon started out as a racist redneck who only cared for his own survival, since the second and third series of the TV show, the character has changed a lot and has attracted a large number of fans. The game is a prequel to the show and you start out by learning what happened during Daryl's early days during the undead scourge. While there aren't any amazing revelations, you do get a bit more information about the characters and there are some characters that get referenced in passing. The good things about this game include a solid combat engine and a range of weapons to choose from. While the combat is not quite as good as Dead Island, you can reliably take down Walkers with stealth attacks and later get stronger weapons. Each melee weapon is different from the speedy but weak hammer to the heavy and slow sledgehammer that can take down walkers in a single hit. In terms of guns you have pistols, shotguns, rifle and of course Daryl's trusty crossbow. You'll want to use the crossbow as much as you can to kill walkers silently and retrieve your crossbow bolts. Silence is important because walkers pick up on sound a lot. One way you can draw walkers away is by throwing a bottle or a flare in the opposite direction, when they charge towards the noise you slip past them the other way. As you progress through the game you'll want to pick up food rations, weapons, ammunition and fuel. Fuel is important for making your way across the map on the road sections. Some of these sections will give you a choice, do you move the car stuck on the road or take an alternative route? One great feature of the game is the survivor management. As you progress in the game, you get access to different survivors. You can only pick up a certain number of survivors, based on the size of your vehicle. While you may sometimes want to save everyone, ultimately you sometimes have to choose a location and hope for the best. Some survivors are also only found on the random encounters and so can be overlooked. It's worth helping them survive since you get a bonus at the end of the game. Sadly it's not all non-stop fun and there are a few bad points about this game. This game is relentlessly hard, with no difficulty select screen. This means that if you're not careful, you will die many times until you learn how to move around properly and what areas are dangerous to be in. You can sometimes get away from walkers in buildings, but often you can get trapped and face an early demise. Another gripe with many people is the game length. At most, the campaign mode can be completed in around 5-8 hours. In other games this isn't such a major problem, but since there is no multiplayer or co-operative modes of any kind, it's a big big problem. The ending is also a bit of a let down as it doesn't really fill in any gaps or explain anything of importance. If you have the option of getting Dead Island then I would suggest that you try that game out first, as it's fairly cheap. Otherwise you could potentially get this game but I would say you should get it cheap, simply because of it's length and problems. It's still pretty fun at times though.",6,PC
"This game was not even completed! The animations look unfinished, concepts are there but not fully implemented, almost everything seems half-arsed and rushed. There appears to be no optimization at all. Changing screen resolution and graphics options crashes my game to desktop followed by a bunch of error messages. It's as if this was an alpha build and some idiot in charge said, ""Release this now!"", and the developers gave up trying to explain to that person that the game wasn't completed. It should have spent a few more months in development. I don't even care that the graphics aren't the best I've seen, I was just hoping for a game that actually worked and was finished, and had all the ideas FULLY implemented into them that were talked about while it was in development; a game that put me into the walking dead world and was tense. I just hate to have to give a game such a low score, but the fact that it was released like this with a $50 price tag ticks me off, and I want everyone to know that they should avoid buying this game like the plague. I seriously doubt they can fix (finish) this game by releasing a series of patches. It's just awful. The one point I do give it is for the fact that they put in RPG elements and the ability to lean to look around corners as well as a few other little things. But these little things that might surprise you and make you say, ""hey, that is cool!"" are just overshadowed by the gut wrenching fact that they are inside of a big steaming pile of over-priced pooh.",1,PC
"The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is an enjoyable game that combines the claustrofobic feeling of being chased by walkers and the need to scavenge in a good way, but the graphics are very dated and some issues keep the experience from its prime.",7,PC
"Yes, this game is a mess, and it was rushed out so it could be bought by YOU, and to take advantage **** fanbase, the Walking Dead fanbase. So is this game worth it? (short answer: NO). The graphics are awful... 2006 standarts, acctualy some of the zombie models look like the models from resident evil 1 REMAKE for the GAMECUBE. The sound is BLHAW... Too basic, the sound effects are sometimes enjoyable. The gameplay, brings something new to the table, you have a fairly deccent item manager, you can gather supplies which is pretty cool, and you can get survivor for your group. So yeah, Is this worth 50$? Nope! Stay away from this game, only get it if its all patched.",5,PC
"It's a real shame this game was made the way it was, an utter cash in with the only redeeming features because the amazing voice acting by Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker. Graphics are a complete let down with rooms being full of nothing more than one chair and a table half the time, if this wasn't a Walking Dead game it wouldn't be worth a second glance.",2,PC
"i don't understand how people are giving 9/10 to this game, i wonder if they are payed or just dunno are still playing games released 15 years ago and they are like wow this is a video game and at 40$+ you would expect AAA quality or refund, this worse than War Z and this is not a compliment.",1,PC
"It's like Day of the Dead (horrible zombie-game on Unreal engine 2), but with «updated» graphics (still looks horrible). The rush with which game was made shows. It's glitchy as hell. Shallow and repetitive gameplay.",2,PC
"I was expecting a game like a TWD in First Person, but i need to admit I was expecting more than a repetitive merry go around of facts and mechanics and a butt-ending that blows me off... taking out the fact of (poor) interacting with other survivors, scavenge of new items for continue adventure with new cars, weapons and more, the game include lack of graphics and Gameplay, that makes the game boring and repetitive... The history isn't that bad, but isn't good though, resuming: only a REAL fan (like me!) will TOLERATE a ONE time gameplay (you finish the game, and you put on your game stash and never touch him again...) Other positive point is the GREAT voice os Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker, they were good in the series, they were good in the game too... Well, if you aren't a REAL BIG FAN of TWD, i think you should prefer to play Left 4 Dead, or No More Room In Hell, even The War Z (just kidding, haha)",5,PC
"I had accepted that it wasn't going to be good because of everyone on discussions but it's actually somewhat good. I witnessed no bugs whatsoever which is a good thing. I never dropped below 60fps with vsync on and everything maxed. EVGA 660. The storyline is good, the areas are well developed. The graphics aren't great but if you like the borderlands and telltale TWD art style then you'll like this. The back story doesn't dissapoint. We learn more about Daryl and Merle as I wanted. The ending, without spoiling anything, leads to the show. It shows how they came to be in Atlanta. Overall I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Skyrim being a 10, WarZ being a 1",7,PC
"At first i thought it is a joke, when i saw the graphics 1st time. But no. It looks like cheap games done 5-7years ago. I said OK... Nevermind, its all about athmosphere so i go on. I played like 30 minutes, got almost done 1st mission and suddenly... game crash! Checkpoints not saved, so i had to start mission over again from the beginning. Next bad thing about TWD: SI, it just freezes all the time, its hard to aim in it at all. There are some better things like map travels, equipment, but its definitly not worth its price. What a waste, especially when there are such awesome characters like Daryl and Merle used.",3,PC
"To start off this game is terrible not worth the $50 price tag at all more like $15. Because it was published by activision the game was rushed out and it's a mess. The controls are clunky and the missions ****. Last, but doesn't matter that much, the graphics look like they came from 2003. Don't buy this game even if you are a die hard TWD fan like me, take your $50 and buy season 3 when it comes out on dvd/blu ray.",0,PC
"The Kings of Cash-In have done it again. I seriously believe that this is what Activision has been reduced to: making bad games to cash in on licenses. This newest FPS cash in is very short so I will make this review short and spoiler free in regard. Walking Dead: Survival Instinct doesn't deserve $50 nor does it deserve $10. Survival Instinct is a complete disrespect to the license and its fans. On the PC version, you will experience horrendous frame rate drops from dated graphics that look like they could have been made for the PlayStation 2 and XBOX. A lazy story that ends abruptly with loose ends (though I seriously doubt Activision is going to release any DLC for this disaster). Terrible voice acting with some of the worst AI I've ever encountered because on five different occurrences, the Walkers in this game **** RAN!!! Also keep in mind that Terminal Reality is used the same engine that was used for Star Wars: Kinect. With that in mind you will experience badly timed QTEs and mini games that probably come from iPhone games and climbing mechanics straight out of Minecraft. If you are a fan of the series then stick with Telltale's version of The Walking Dead.",2,PC
"I have to change my initial review because this game is BROKEN,and that's sad because it could have been so much fun The first 2 hours are fine and they shows a promise it will get better and better but it actually it's getting way worst.Zombie AI is unacceptable in stealth based gameplay i get spotted in so random situations i were scratching my head how has that happened.Location design is ok,it kept me wondering what's going to be around the corner (at least before it become schematic),however you CAN'T SAVE during a missions and some of them can be very long especially if you try to play ****:SI got a great atmosphere and it would be a surprisingly fun even with 6 years dated graphic,but it's totally broken game because of horrible zombie AI,sometimes weird quest design (zombies jumping on you from nowhere after for example you pick up a key),and invisible walls (keeping you away from strategic decisions sometimes).I want to play a game like this but a one that actually works.Avoid at any cost.",1,PC
"this game really reminds me of the good old Medal of Honor on PS1, compass, graphics, it's almost the same, it would have been the best FPS in 1998 before Half-Life, now it's just garbage, the only good Walking Dead is from Telltale Games, this is complete waste of time, exactly like the tv show.",1,PC
"As a huge fan of the series and also zombie video games I was looking forward to try this game. Can't say I'm disappointed because what I feel is more than that. Can't still believe they used that awesome series name for this crap. Graphics is somewhere on Quake 2 level but that's not too important (remember Payday: The Heist with terrible gfx and awesome game). Gameplay is even worse than gfx and audio also terrible. I almost never give games score 0 because there is at least effort of programmers and we should respect that. Here, seems no even effort to make playable game.",0,PC
"This is not a Telltale Game! So expect it to be bearable. Unlike the God awful Telltale Game this has game play. Which will allow you to got through the subpar graphics and meh story.

The Game play is fairly fun. Unlike Telltale Games this game actually is fun to play.",4,PC
"Played for 25 minutes and unistalled. The game has horrible quality, idiotic gameplay and super linear. The oposite of ""The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series"". The only good think is the recorded voice Daryl and his brother. Dont buy this trash! It is an insult to the franchize.",0,PC
"This is probably one of the worst games I have ever played. I actually can't believe that they released this game in the condition that it's in.

If you played the game Land of the Dead imagine a much worse Next-gen version of that. I can't believe this game is retail for $50. It should be $20 at most. Do not buy, do not look at it even. It's bad. Really bad.",0,PC
"The game clearly doesn't deserve 50$, I took all my time to finish it, it took me 6 hours. Graphics are really bad but that was not a big deal, the gameplay was catchy and the voiceover was amazing, from the two series actors. I was quiet optimist through the whole game, but then the game just ended, probably the worst ending ever in the video games industry.

"Mediocre graphics, but great voiceovers and cleverly developed storyline and mechanics. Immersive and scary in the tradition of DayZ, and you get to be Daryl -||| This wasn't a megadevelopment project by EA Games (hey look you weren't robbed!). Regardless, the graphics aren't notable, but they don't really detract from the game once you get into it. It is EXTREMELY immersive. The survival aspects are really fun. If you start firing a rifle in the middle of town, the hordes are coming for you and you're screwed.. this I've never seen in another zombie game! You can use stealth and cunning to more efficiently take zombies out.. it's kind of a sandbox in that you have tasks, but you are free to complete them however you like. Norman Reedus does an outstanding job of doing the voiceovers (sooo much better than what other actors have done in video games!), and his voiceovers aren't just in cut scenes, but also when he's killing zombies or gathering supplies. The storyline is consistent with The Walking Dead. This was done in collaboration with AMC, and was obviously written by the show's writers. Even if it wasn't so much fun, so scary, and so challenging, it's a look into how the Dixon brothers got where they were in Season1 Episode1... and that's some really sweet icing on the cake!",9,PC

"For the first time in my life I met a game in which I liked only one thing.This is her idea.Yes, the idea of ​​the adventures of Gollum after the loss of the ring has not yet occurred to them with more than one Tolkien.Everything, absolutely everything else in the game is made by the rear left little finger of the upper front curve of the leg growing from the ass.Everything is broken in the game, there is no one of course, at least on the PlayStation 5, it is quite possible, but this is unlikely to give you 15 hours of happiness.And so the first thing that stunned after launch is how HDR works in the game.Absolutely nothing is visible on the screen, the darkness is impenetrable.I had to turn off the HDR.Then I was just dumbfounded by graphics and animation, and indeed the appearance of all the NPS and our hero in this game.This is the graphon well ps2 and xbox.Heroes say without opening their mouths, without changing facial expressions, move like paralytics, sometimes not moving their feet.It is immediately obvious that the authors are not that they did not read books, but Jackson’s films are neglecting or at all not watched.Everyone in the game has an appearance simply radically does not correspond to what has now become a classic.Yes, what is there.The local elves are generally 100% Indians.Communications or Apachi in combat coloring.You’re even lost like that.There is such a Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, so Monolith, without having any license for images from Jackson’s films, nevertheless created images of both heroes and enemies with such a macar that the game of the game was spent with the generally accepted, already classic.Now gameplay.He is terrible.I understand that the authors wanted to draw inspiration from Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, but they got the parkour more like that of the first Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain.Everything is done at a very low level.Our hero may jump, may not jump, can jump onto the shoots on the right, or can fly into the abyss, sometimes he is just like a flying squirrel to seem out to be inaccessible to the ledges, and sometimes cannot jump over the meter hole.In general, Gollum has some kind of inertia, he begins to move with a slip, and he can not stop immediately, but slipping half a meter along the texture, and may stop immediately.Random.Throughout the game, my hero ""died"" probably 200 times, if not more, he did not die in any Salislaik.About this fucking dialogue of our Hollya and Smeagol, at each revival at the control point after death, you will hate these terrible 15 seconds and this nasal voice.I even turned off the sound in places where I often had to die.Already to nausea.This is some kind of nightmare.Well, at least a car of the conservation here is quite frequent and you do not have to replay for 15 minutes.Gollum has super vision and it illuminates enemies and important objects, but there could be alas, there was no place for.Since the game has sooo a lot of this parku, and the graphics are 25 years old, all the surfaces look like a piece of soap and it is sometimes simply impossible to notice on this soap.Often you just jump at random.But all these are trifles.The game has races with a view of the face of Gollum.Yes, I thought these perversions were banned in PS3 even in time, but as you can see not.There are pokatushki on a cart with dumps from obstacles.But the ""berry"" on this cake from shit mission with the task: ""Get out of the fog.""15 minutes of a slow passage along an absolutely linear corridor filled with a violet haze, without enemies without, and without everything!Why is this?Execution, like everything is just terrible.Forgot.The Lord of the Rings: Gollum gameplay authors fatly diluted naturally with stealth.Ooo!With local graphics, sometimes it is not at all clear where the orc has a face, but where is the ass.Does he look at you or aside?Do not make out.That is why it was impossible to add an enemy’s vision, at least in the super vision of Gollum?Sometimes the enemy will not clearly see you or not, replayed the same places several times and sometimes the orcs/elves fell, and sometimes not.Some enemies without armor can be strangled in steadily, while others can not be.How to determine?And not how, by death.Three times the orc killed you, so this cannot be strangled.Again with random.Honestly, he really hoped that the authors would still be pulled up in almost a year, repaired, change something in the game with patches.But no.The bread does not fly out.Oddly enough, the game is still not included in the PS Plus Extra and this is generally the first major discount on this game in the Play Store.At a discount, for 1000 rubles., I bought it.I do not advise others.At the end of the torment, I suddenly clearly understood, but the game was made not now and not for PS4/PS5.But it is not strange, a year old year in 2001 or 2005.For consoles, let's say PS2 or the first Xbox, when, by the way, the Lord of the Rings was at the very peak of popularity.Just an unsuccessful and forgotten project in 2022 was opened and given to Daedalic, by whom he was transferred to a more or less modern engine without any effort.This was already, say, with Duke Nukem Forever.In short, the game is not interesting, not beautiful, not playable, but it is just annoying.Yes, what the story of such a character as Gollum is available, but again it is not interesting, and most importantly not at all obligatory.I put 3 for the idea.",3,PLAYSTATION 5

"With phenomenal next-gen visuals, a rich and compelling story, and a great lead character, The Lord of the Rings Gollum remains a peak for what gaming should be like, especially in a year like 2023. The gameplay is simple as any stealth platformer can get but there's several incredible elements that make this game in a league of its own. There are instances where Gollum will undergo a seizure while climbing vines which I think adds an element of challenge to the platforming and punishes players for going about it mindlessly. I also really enjoyed the choices between Gollum and Smeagol, really makes me feel like I'm molding his character and the story into how I want it to be, something that should be implemented into more games because it makes the player's choices matter. Overall, LOTR Gollum is up there for one of my favorite games of 2023 due to its challenging yet engaging gameplay that I can revisit plenty of times.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

The notion that the developers didn't care about the IP is something I definitely disagree with. It's apparent there is some passion in here but the game is simply so poorly conceived and flawed by design that is squanders any potential the game could have even if it was executed well (which its not). Normally, I wouldn't be too harsh on an experimental game with an inexperienced dev team but the asking price of $60 makes the value proposition so unacceptable that the game and publisher deserve all the criticism they've received.

"Truly the worst video game ever developed by humanity. Will dismantle your sanity from top to bottom! You thought Jedi Survivor had horrendous performance optimization? Gollum bests it in garbage at every turn with continuous frame rate drops from Lucifier's most malignant garden concocted. Unspeakably abysmal gameplay with the worst platforming of all time. Phasing through levels is normal now. Frame tears constantly, stuttering borderline schizophrenia psychosis! As if ANYONE developing this waste of silicon isn't certifiably Borderline Personality Disorder! To make a game this putrid takes serious effort and Daedalic Entertainment has truly gone the extra miles to make you LOATHE video games that ever resemble Lord Of The Rings again. There isn't a character that won't make you desire permanent blindness, with nonexistent art design or vision to back up this trash. Unspeakable controls which restrict movement and freedom at every turn. UI from the bottom of hell. Gollum is the worst offender of all, with a preschool garbage voiceover who is an utter disgrace to the legendary Andry Serkis in every POSSIBLE metric. But it gets even more abysmal, as Daedalic Entertainment actually thought giving Gollum an emo haircut that Chemical Romance would excrement their pants mocking for hours on end in front of a live audience of thousands. The game over screen will glitch you out of the game randomly. Gollum serves as a slave for carboard orcs with zero personality or soul, as if anything in this game was developed by people with souls. If you like an under 20 FPS garbage climbing simulator, pressing PS1 quality levers and utterly amateurish level designs that make Ride To Hell Retribution play like Tears Of The Kingdom, **** I have the video game for you! Of course LOTR Gollum has eye gouging microtransactions and lootboxes too! There isn't one element of good game design that LOTR Gollum doesn't desecrate and violate without apology, one single aspect of gameplay this garbage doesn't utterly **** up. I highly recommend as many people purchase LOTR Gollum as possible, for the sole purpose of a public burning of every copy and a Kickstarter to ensure Daedalic Entertainment is forbidden from ever developing another Lord Of The Rings game ever again. The WORST OF THE WORST, actual simulated torture from hell, the cancer of the industry.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

"Now standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the fantastic Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor (2014) and Middle-earth: Shadow of War (2017) duology comes The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. This epic tale from Daedalic Entertainment and Nacon offers gamers an opportunity to experience a journey through the eyes of Middle-earth’s most underrated character—the eponymous Gollum. This game takes place many decades after the events of The Hobbit, and features untold sequences that shed further light upon the darkness of Mordor, and the tragedy of Gollum. This title is a third-person, action-adventure game, featuring stealth and platforming across a variety of iconic destinations. Gollum provides a journey unlike any other, and should be a necessary addition to the collection of any self-respecting Middle-earth fan. Regarding story, this game definitely has something to say. I would hate to spoil this exhilarating twelve-hour tale, so I will keep details to a minimum. However, it must be noted that Gollum takes place parallel to the events of The Fellowship of the Ring, and happens to feature a similar level of vision, scale, and refinement in storytelling. With all this being said, there should be no question that the narrative alone is worth the price of admission. The “Precious Edition” is currently priced at $69.99 USD (tax not included, $2.99 “Emotes Pack” also not included). Regarding gameplay, this title is something you can absolutely play. The platforming mechanics rival that of the storied Uncharted franchise, offering a greater sense of verticality, production value, and fantastical adventure. The stealth gameplay is also exceptionally detailed and thought-out, constantly delivering sneaking experiences that are just as thrilling and polished as the platforming sequences. The stealth is so engaging, that it even makes the original stealth saga, Metal Gear Solid, noticeably obsolete and far less original by comparison. However, the real highlight of this game is the ability to make choices that critically impact key points of the narrative. Gamers can choose to side with either the good Sméagol side, or the evil Gollum side. This gameplay inclusion is very fitting of Gollum, and thus allows each of the qualities of such a complex and layered character to truly shine—namely his single-minded, shallow, and one-dimensional pursuit of the One Ring. A Gollum-led game is indubitably a concept that needed to be fleshed out and delivered one day. I am happy to report that after several delays, this idea has finally arrived at a playable state. The game delivers top-of-the-line graphics, and a narrative recounted with a stunningly large attention to detail. The constant texture pop-ins, FPS drops, and stuttering help to convey the fractured mind of the title’s eponymous protagonist, as he is pressured to retell his magical adventure. These efforts deserve commendation, and while the canon of Monolith Productions’s duology is up for debate, I would argue that Gollum is worthy of becoming canon along with The Rings of Power. While I personally do not have any notable criticisms to make of Gollum, I have seen a handful of critiques claiming that this game is deserving of universal disapproval. Complaints cite things like “it’s nothing but fetch quests,” “nobody wanted a Gollum game,” and “why?”. One notable commenter I saw kept on insisting that there are vastly superior games to play right now, such as Resident Evil 4 (2023), The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Street Fighter 6, and Final Fantasy XVI. To that I must say, I have already experienced Leon Kennedy murdering villagers in 2005, I have thrust my sword through Ganondorf on multiple occasions, I have caved Chun-Li’s face in as Ryu, and I have watched Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. I have not witnessed a journey as Gollum before. I do not support any of these blasphemous claims, as I have faced no such issues while playing this game. Regardless of these unjustified critiques, in addition to not actually owing a copy of The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, I do own a PlayStation 5 home gaming console, which grants me authority to speak on this issue. In conclusion, I cannot recommend Middle-earth: Shadow of War enough, so please go out and purchase this product. Get ready for an orc-throttling good time!",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Fans of the movies and books can certainly do something with ""The Lord of the Rings: Gollum"". The plot continues to be told by Gollum and we are presented with new information.

"I finished the game and I must say that it's a huge lost potential. As a LOTR fan and gamer, I'm very disappointed. The idea was good but the execution resembles something I would have expected to see perhaps 15 years ago. Apparently the project was too big for the development company to handle, they clearly didn't have experience making this kind of games as l've read so far they've only done 2D click-point games. The graphics is just embarrassingly ugly, I guess they tried to give it a special fantasy look, but it didn't end well. Not pleasant to look at at all. NPCs were a bit boring and I've had a lot of issues with controlling of the character. The story was OK, I believe with better graphics, more side content and greatly improved variety of surrounding and performance, it would be a decent game. But in the current state I wish this game never happened and I do regret preordering it. They should have sold the idea to a company that was up to the challenge!",2,PLAYSTATION 5

I wanted it to succeed before it released because of my positive past experiences with the Peter Jackson Movies and PS4 generation games, Shadow of Mordor and Shadow of War.

So far, it seems only the most tedious and repetitive cliches of gaming have been added— scale a marked area of the wall or cliff, hide in the tall grass, collect 8 name tags and turn them in. They understand Lord of the Rings, but I guess not modern gamers. Honestly, I don’t know how it could have worked anyway, since Golem isn’t known for being adept in intense combat in the way Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor/War was so great.

Are you freaking kidding me? Look at how awful those physics are. It doesn't even have any actual physics, meaning these developers didn't even try.

The state of this game would've been insulting as an early-gen PS3/360-era game. Nevermind nowadays. The worst part is that they officially released marketing footage and photos that were abysmal. The game looked awful even then. And somehow in the actual game, it got 10x worse. Every studio involved with this game is inept. I got my refund, so I'm all good.

This ""game"" is not about gollum it's about the characters around gollum 5. Story is trash it belongs in the dumpster 6. Theres even a graphical bug where the screen flashes horribly I even got a seizure 7. If you want the ""full game"" you need to buy ALL the dlc It's stuff that you normally see in completed games lore compendium lore accurate elf dialogue etc. Ok overall this ""game"" can't be fixed it need a massive rework from the ground up In my eyes if I see Daedalic Entertainment in any of the future games I'm most likely not gonna buy it (Luckely I got my money back)",0,PLAYSTATION 5

"As a longtime fan of LOTR, this game is such a blow to the fandom - it was announced in 2019 and then delayed for 2 years. At best this game is an early PS3 game - and reminiscent of the time when a game was based together to milk the back end of a movie, with basic level design, quests that don't even make sense in the grand scheme of things and a fundamental disregard for the motivations of gollum as a character. It goes a step further though, if all the above wasn't enough, it wants to charge for the additional content that games of similar pricepoints include - something I find absolutely abhorrent. This game was a day one buy for me, luckily, I was able to get a full refund. I hope Daedelic can sort themselves out in future - but I really cannot see anything helping this absolute shambles ****.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

Bad- Poor NPC designs; Rough animations; Poor pacing caused by out-of-place sequences not typical of the majority of the game; Not much depth to the overall gameplay. Thoughts- Despite being presented as a lonely creature, Gollum gets more attention than he might deserve in The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. With average by-the-books platforming and stealth gameplay, there actually is a thoughtful and engaging story at the heart of Gollum. It’s up to fans of the genre to decide whether time spent on ordinary gameplay is worth experiencing Gollum’s history.",5,PLAYSTATION 5

"I am absolutely loving this game, it features one of the most original stories in the LoTR franchise and the gameplay is both fun and exciting. Sure, there are some bugs here and there but they will be patched quickly enough, Daedalic isn't the first studio to fall victim **** publisher setting an unreasonable deadline and it won't be the last. However this is a genuinely fantastic game that will delight TRUE fans of the LoTR franchise and leave the haters, losers and fair-weather ""fans"" by the wayside as they cry and whine about things like ""Gollum is ugly"" (oh really? was Timothée Chalamet not available for the role?) and ""the graphics are bad"" (tell me, how were the ""graphics"" in the original JRR Tolkien novels again?) despite not having even played the game.

DO NOT BUY!!!!! If you want to play an excellent LOTR game i highly recommend Shadow of Mordor and War respectively. Also Gollum in War is WAYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than this and he's only an NPC.Luckily i haven't bought Gollum cause i was very sceptical. Another negative thing is that if you want to hear the Elvish language you have to buy the DLC. The game shouldn't exist in my opinion and it reminds me a game from the 2004 - 2009 **** devs made this game because there's a huge fan base on LOTR that they'll buy anything they throw at them which they hoped it sold very well. The game's overwhelming negativity made me replay the Shadow series.,0,PLAYSTATION 5

"Normally I often read game reviews before I buy them to see what I am getting into. This was a blind buy because I am a LotR fan and thought I could expect a great game. I was very mistaken. Bought and played on PS5. Graphics: 3/10 I have seen better graphics on a PS3 game. These graphics are so outdated it is just not funny at all. I even tried setting the parameters to Quality and also tried Quality with Ray Tracing. Quality seemed very dull and bland, not much texture. Whereas Quality with Ray Tracing just made everything grainy, like looking at sand blowing in the wind. Movement/Controls: 3/10 Very bad and very basic. I have not experienced any of the glitches or bugs I am reading about like Gollum not grabbing a ledge when he should. But it just seems like there should have been more to it then walk/run and jump. You can occasionally kill an orc by choking him out, unless of course they are wearing a helmet. Which 98% of them are.. and the ones wearing a straw hat, ya that counts as a helmet i guess. Story: 6/10 The story is the one shining light to this game, however if you know nothing about the LotR universe then you will know nothing about this game or its story. It will seem hard to pick certain things up to, for example when Gollum continually talks about Shelob. He never mentions her name and only describes her so you wont know who he is talking about unless you know the lore. Lore: 1/10 They could have made this a big hit but instead its just collectibles scattered around the maps. No story behind them or what they are. For example one collectible is a bats wing..... and that's it. You have collected a bats wing. Overall 2/10 This is hands down one of the worst purchases I have made in many years and really, really regret it. Plus I got the DLC which makes it more expensive. By the way you don't need the DLC, it does nothing for the game unless you want to hear elves speak elvan and get some Gollum emotes. Which at the time of this writing neither work for me. It says ""On"" in the DLC menu. But I get nothing. You also get art and the games soundtrack... whatever.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"PS3 era graphics, story makes no sense at all. Design of Gollum is a disaster compared to the movies. This game is bad at all fronts so really bold move to sell this game for the AAA 60 bucks price tag. Clearly some fanboys are trolling here, cause giving 10 to this crap makes no sense at all.

"Lord of the Rings: Gollum, developed by Daedalic Entertainment and published by Nacon, aims to be a faithful adaptation of Tolkien’s lore, but lands as one of the most misguided and painful gaming experiences in recent memory. Despite lofty ambitions, the story is a dull retread of familiar territory, offering little of value even to diehard Middle-earth fans. Gollum’s internal struggle—a character-defining trait—is reduced to an unengaging mini-game, while the bulk of the narrative is framed through Gandalf’s exposition and a flashback prison sequence that somehow feels both lifeless and endless. There’s a moment that lightly echoes Shawshank Redemption, but don’t get it twisted—this game barely scratches the surface of emotional or character depth.Visually, the game is a muddy mess. Environments are drab blobs of brown and gray, with PS2-era textures and uninspired design, and somehow even the Orcs—normally a visual highlight of the franchise—look embarrassingly bad. The gameplay is where Gollum really falls apart. Platforming, supposedly its core mechanic, is insultingly easy, riddled with clunky controls and braindead enemy AI. The game practically drags you from ledge to ledge, and any tension in its stealth sections is destroyed by laughably poor enemy behavior and a system so forgiving it feels like a toddler’s first stealth game. You know you’re in trouble when you die more often from input lag than from any actual **** its core, Lord of the Rings: Gollum feels unfinished—a glorified proof of concept with a $50 price tag. Even the studio’s inevitable apology tweet felt pre-written, like they knew this disaster was coming. The only silver lining? It’s mercifully short, clocking in at under 15 hours. I played it on PC, where it’s technically playable on the Steam Deck, though the experience is no better for it.",1,PC
"I honestly enjoyed the game. Yes it's very basic. Yes it has some glitches. Yes, the controls are not obvious sometimes. But for true LotR fan this game will be a good spin-off to walk through the fanfic representation of the Middle-Earth. I paid for the game 15$ and it was absolutely worth it. For the current 90% discount (5$ price) it's an absolute steal. LotR fans must have it. All the rest average fellow gamers won't enjoy the game I think. Should it have 60$ price tag at launch? Absolutely not. Does the game deserves all the hate? Absolutely not. Take care, guys.",9,PC
"The Lord of the Rings: Gollum falls short of its potential, offering a lackluster and purposeless gaming experience. Failing to explore the complexity of Gollum's character and presenting uninspired gameplay, the game struggles to provide a compelling reason for players to embark on this desolate journey through Middle-earth. Technical glitches further dampen the overall experience, making Gollum's adventure a disappointing endeavor.",4,PC

"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience playing Gollum. I ran across very minimal bugs and glitches. First glitch was near the end of the game, had a short restart and everything fine. The beautiful world this game builds is very immersive. Has all the right feelings of a Lord of the Rings game. The lore behind Gollum is very captivating. The movement while slightly clunky, felt good once you were in the rhythm of things. If anyone is a TRUE LoTR Fan, you will thoroughly enjoy this game and the narrative it unveils to you. I had very little to complain about for the $25 I paid for the game.",9,PC

"This game is the most overrated of all time. This game is awful. It is an empty mess with no direction. The first 20 minutes of the game are playable, but the rest is just a bore and a mess. The game is empty. There is nothing in it. Like Skyrim, the story is boring and driven by doing mindless story tasks for some random NPC that you talk to. Press A a bunch of times, scroll through the boring text, find out you have to talk to some other dude, walk halfway across a completely empty, completely thoughtless, completely boring map to find some other random NPC so you can unlock a silly story mission so you can talk to some more boring people. It is a very dull game. It gets huge praise because of its silly illusion that you are a survivor in this giant open world. But the open world is empty! There is nothing to do in it. Boring task, that's all that's in it. Boring tasks that detract from the game feel, detract from the characters and even the story! And the gameplay is nothing short of a insult to what the game is. Take a terrible game, make it a first person shooter and that's how you complete the turd trifecta. I can see why people would find this game ""interesting"" but a First Person Shooter with no charm and no innovative features that make it feel worth playing, in an empty world, boring NPCs and even dull graphics doesn't sound like a good time to me. Game of the Decade? Please. Sit down turn on this that you love so much and run around with a gun in a that empty world and accept that one boring task from that ugly NPC that you skipped because you thought it was boring and then tell me its a good game. This is not what a good game is.",2,XBOX 360
"The game is okay by itself, if it were a standalone or a spin-off it would be kind of good. Now that's the worst part, it tries to be a successor to a series it really just doesn't have the goods to be. A lot of the quests lack any sort of emotion or critical thinking that made the first game so good, your actions had true impact. But in this you don't even get a small puzzle or area that requires thinking, it's either walk across a massive game world, shoot something, or talk to someone. And the style of the story definately doesn't fit the Fallout franchise, anybody who says this game lives up to the originals is dead wrong. The ending is FAR too much of a ""Happy ending"" for this game to be anything close to what is a bleak existance even after your character becomes a walking tank helping everybody in the originals. Now the gameplay and mechanics not relating to the originals are pretty good, it would be more of a ""Save your money, buy it if you don't have anything to play"" kind of game not considering the story. The story itself is also fine, but also lacks true depth and is quite bland. I would say you should save your money, the game is OKAY but it is far from as good as people say it to be.",3,XBOX 360
"This game doesn't deserve even a 1. You may spend a ,long time walking from one side of the map to the other, only then to feel de ja vu, as you are sure you have just been here, and the reason for that is, you have. The whole map looks the same with little variation, Voice acting in this game is horrendous and is a bore, making it unbearable to go of trying to find side quests, which are boring in themselves, and the story is boring and also a lot of the people in this game say exactly the same thing making the experience even more dull and boring. fair enough I haven't completed the story and it may get better towards the end but, because of the games flaws I don't think i will ever be able to reach the end, One more thing, within the 10 hours that I have played this game it has crashed my xbox 4 times, giving me no choice than to turn off my xbox and turn it back on reverting to my last save which can be a long time ago. a waste of my time and my money.",0,XBOX 360

"Magnificent open world, too bad that it is also partitioned and scripted in its missions: like a cabot we follow the instructions to the letter, we will seek and we report thei.Like a robot we obey, no real freedom in this open world which has never seemed so closed.And if it is beautiful, if we see far, it also raises very often, the game being unable to maintain the 30 imm/s.When we add to that the maneuverability always as rigid and the interface badly fucked up, we quickly realize that it is a damn ordeal to play.Nothing new under the sun therefore, GTA 5 remains faithful to itself: a cardboard time.Except by car, the only successful phase of the game ... Another concern that drips enormously: it speaks a lot, it speaks all the time, it does not stop, **** Mother **** a **** ya all the time for a yes one for a no, they never close it.All the characters are caricatures, even passers -by, anyone (even passers -by do not stop talking and telling anything).If at least it was funny but not even ... and despite the crazy money that Rockstar is made, no French version on the horizon.Certainly the 3 playable characters are a plus and there is no shortage of tarantine situations (it is not necessarily a compliment to tell the truth) so why this absence of female character among the 3?Are they all misogynists at Rockstar or simply gays?Especially that I am forced to play a mental stupid among the 3 which does not have fun at all ... But the most serious is the atrocious maneuverability, all this cash in development and still not screwed to make a correct time, however, for 15 years that they make GTA but they still do not know.Fed up with their bullshit.",3,XBOX 360

"The story was great, enjoyed that. Everyone complains about that, and not the gameplay. GTA for me is a way to escape reality, enjoy the chaos and mayhem part, fighting it out with the police, and other general fun stuff. But did this installment offer that? To me it took away the fun I had of playing past entries in that regard, and that is what made me sour for the game. I actually get punished for going on a high speed police chase, by overpowered and over realistic AI. The game goes from being a game, to a life simulator, where you are forced to follow the rules and if you break them, you have to deal with insanely fast police cars, helicopters, and police who can shoot you from around corners and have x-ray vision. GTA 4 had the perfect police system in my opinion, it could have been tweaked a bit, but they had it perfect. Exploration was great, up until being mauled by mountain lions every time I set foot in the country side. I don't mind the thrill of wild beasts, but I think there was just too much of that. Sharks in the game were in limited quantities and restricted to certain areas, why not the same for mountain lions?",3,XBOX 360
"Very dumbed down car handling. It is pathetic and I bet that was made for all that casual players that dont know nothing about real world physics etc. So that kids can have fun in stupid games but when they grow up they are making car accidents because they have no idea about real car handling. Pathetic game because of what they did to car physics. And that funny ability to rock car back on wheels hahaha another feature for dumb kids. GTA is so childish that it hurts. I will not buy that game. I only hope that good moders will fix that pathetic childish car handling on PC version. Also add speedometer, fuel usage and stuff that will make this game more real so it will not look so much dumbed down. In terms of weapons they made better work compared to GTA4 but they still are away from real counterparts. For example shotguns can be reloaded with one single shell WTF rockstar you imbeciles! All this inconsistency and dumbing down is degraded my score like crazy even if there is lots of cool things in this game then it is obliterated by those imbecile designs that I mentioned above.",2,XBOX 360

"I understand that a lot of people enjoy GTA V. I admit that it has some excellent story missions with truly creative and clever ideas. However, I do not enjoy playing this game and I believe that the critics that gave this game a perfect rating let their excitement get the better of them. GTA V deserves some criticism and in my opinion it is very far from the 'ultimate sandbox game' that many people have described it to be. GTA has no inspiring features, you simply rob stores and screw hookers similarly to how you do in the previous games. The only truly iconic feature that GTA V has brought to its franchise is being able to control three separate characters. This makes for some pretty cool bits of gameplay in the story missions, but it's completely pointless in the open world. The whole time I played in the open world, I always stuck to playing as Trevor and had no reason to change. Shooting in this game is somehow even less fun here than it is in GTA IV. I've never liked the auto-aim in these games, but at least in GTA IV you could just shoot your next target without having to use it. In GTA V it punishingly difficult to try to aim and kill someone without auto-aim, with your marker being so small and the camera so stiff. The easiest way to kill anyone is to flick your LT and RT triggers in sequence, which makes this mechanic boring in a game with little other gameplay to offer. The open world is the most disappointing feature. No matter how alive Rocksteady has worked to make the world feel alive, once you've completely the main missions the open world simply feels dead. Sure you can do side activities such as sports like golf and tennis, but all of these activities have little reward and just feel tedious. Furthermore, the graphics in this game are also not as outstanding as it has been boasted. Truly, when you think about the detail in other sandbox games like Just Cause 2, which came out earlier and has a bigger open world, GTA V looks much worse. My final problem with GTA V is with its online mode. There's nothing left to do in it! There are races, a few missions (which you have to play by yourself), and that's it! If you're in a map with your friends the most amount of fun you will have will come from robbing stores and getting involved in car chases, but these will get old quickly. The main appealing aspect about an online mode is its co-operative heists, but these still aren't available to play meaning there's little-to-nothing to do in the same extremely dull open world at all. I don't completely hate GTA V, and I respect Rockstar. This game gets some things spot-on-right, for example, I enjoyed almost all of the story missions, I especially enjoyed the excellent ending decision you had to make, the characters were interesting, and the dialogue was well-written and sometimes very funny. While I think the gameplay is repetitive and uninspired some people clearly love it and there is a reason why it has such a devoted fanbase. Many people love this game, I understand that. But there are many others who don't like it such as myself and my friends, and it's difficult for people like us to overlook these looming problems. If Rockstar wants to make there next GTA game more appealing there are many places they can start, for example, create more interior sections in the open world and give us an option from the launch date to play co-operative missions and heists with our friends. To be honest, however, I don't want Rockstar to return to this franchise ever again. It is an overall uninteresting, unappealing and uninspired concept to many people such as myself. Rockstar has made so many more defining and unique open-world games in the past such as Red Dead Redemption and Bully, both of which have much better characters and much more immersive open worlds than there are in all of the GTA games combined. I hope they return to games like these in the future and bring us more of these other excellent titles that are still talked about. Please Rockstar, abandon GTA and focus on making a sequel to your best work.",4,XBOX 360

"A long, drawn out mess of glitches, stress, and broken promises, Grand Theft Auto V is just not what could be considered ""industry standard"" in modern gaming. Rockstar seems to have rushed to the point that they released a game with no content, and are having to play ""catch-up"" in order to avoid chasing off most fans. How this game manages such high ratings is far beyond me! I will admit, I was a **** that went out (having loved all the GTA games I've played) and purchased the whole collector's edition deal. I was thoroughly satisfied with my purchase, and enjoyed playing single player in eager anticipation of ""Grand Theft Auto: Online"", the big deal multiplayer for this game that wasn't even released with the game, but weeks after. I figured that it would not be a problem, they must have taken their time. I'll enjoy the single player story, which is the only reason I am even giving this game a 3 and not a 1. The story is phenomenal. I laughed, got frustrated (but in a good way), and enjoyed seeing these three characters slowly work their way together to be the syndicate crime trio they ended as. Moving on to the not-so-great, multiplayer in this game is so many DLC packs behind where they originally promised that it is utterly sickening. I can count five times that the infamous ""Heist Update"" was mentioned, and yet it is still ""not quite ready for release"" according to Rockstar's official statements at the release of one of the many filler packs (consisting mostly of clothes, weapons, and sometimes the same bland cars you've seen before), the ""I'm Not A Hipster Pack"". I cannot speak for readers of this review, but I have grown very tired of stale downloadable content that just screams copy-paste-recolor, and that is all I feel they have done with GTA Online. From one horrible decision to the next, with ever-so-slight fixes in the game that are few and far-between, GTA Online fails to compete to even the simplicity of GTA IV's online mode, in which glitches do not run rampant, and money is not an issue that is constantly being worked on (and microtransacted). I cannot say that I feel I got my money's worth with this game. The story was great, but when you were promised something so much more, it is upsetting. Rockstar, you have created a monster of a poor game in a very modern and new gaming generation, and I fear that it will harm you severely, with many players flocking to next-gen consoles. I understand a release for GTA V on the new generation consoles is coming soon, but you have to ask yourself: ""Would I spend even more money on this game, just to get the same broken promises?"" I know I certainly am having second thoughts. What would you do, Rockstar?",3,XBOX 360
"Everything you want in a GTA game except the game. Intentionally broken and poorly implemented features will have you grinding for money both online and off. The reasons for doing so, however, aren't really apparent. offline You can buy clothes but your character doesn't keep them. You can customize cars but the don't always stay saved and they don't become your personal car. You can't store stolen jets reliably. They disappear if you switch to a plane you've bought. Online the clothes stay and the vehicle system is much better (why not let you buy and save different cars as your default car offline and have a mechanic who brings them to you? It's already there online and it would so complete the offline experience.) but the Push to get you to buy in-game $$ with real $$ is so strong online that you'll find yourself either grinding the same $18,0000 mission- rooftop rumble- hundreds of times or glitch grinding. to get that $1.5 mil tank. You have to play rooftop rumble 83 times. and no, you can't steal one and store it. They have a rule that says no. You'll play it another 27 times to get the nicest apartment and another 55 times to get a good car. Why not other missions? Well because 18k is about as high as it gets and rooftop rumble is the most efficient in terms of time. Of course maybe you just want to screw with your fellow online players. Well no, now they shame you for that and put you in groups with exclusively **** and missions with exclusively people who rage quit ending the mission prematurely. GTA has long been a game that makes you go ""look at all the stuff I can do!"" GTA V makes you go "" look at all the stuff I can.. Sort of do. Wait, let me just play the same mission 500 times so that I can do this stuff"" it's always been a franchise that' let's you go and break all the rules. This time they've just implemented a bunch of rules to keep you from doing anything fun.

The story is too weak and you can clearly see where the money has gone into: ADVERTISEMENTS. The most interesting thing in the game were the heists, which where pretty cool to do, but oh no! imbicile Rockstar only lets you do just the ones that are in the story..... wtf why?

"Grand Theft Auto V.. Compared to IV Is easily the most overhyped game I've seen in a while. The things it does better firstly, is obviously the graphics, they are beautiful and reflective and pushes these ageing consoles to their max. But some textures on clothes were really muddy looking. And that's it... Now the things it fails on. Story: unlike able protagonists, all three of them, didn't really feel like authentic people more of a exaggeration of stereotypes. The story is the same Rockstar trend. Work for someone, get betrayed, get revenge. So it feels uninspired. Gameplay: what has changed? It's still your third person cover shooter, requires no skill what's so ever all you have to do is run to a good cover spot, peek out, and do a head shot. Wow, and what's the point of all these weapons? It's easy as **** anyways. Not like there is different styles to play through with. ""Silencers"" rigggght about that, well that never worked. I like the driving, but wish they improved the crash physics, this isn't NFS I want, it would be far more immersive if they had the sense of urgency to not crash in high speed chases, but hey if your going 200 mph and hit another car? Just a scratch, cars most have one strong body shell huh. Content: well yes it has a fair bit of hours packed into this game, but it's unrewarding, seriously I'm gonna collect all this for TEN DOLLARS?? Lol, that was a waste of time, a lot of the side missions are collectibles, like it's not really my favourite thing in the first place, but al least far cry 3 gave you XP, this is they give you money.

"The game, when it came out was great, but the ""good"" part was very short lived, as R* started patching it, and the game is unplayable as it stands. Single Player is so buggy that you have to resort to loading whole game from Xbox/PS3 home menu in order for the whole console not to hang. Gameplay bugs, missions which can't be finished, achievements which are not granted, money which is not given, cars disappearing, after spending time and money upgrading them, are all annoying but wouldn't be such a pain if it wasn't for the loading freeze. And money making in GTAV is a total grinder. Yes, you can steal anything, but you can't keep it, as the game doesn't save what's stolen. AI is 100% accurate, the amount of police and agents, and number of helis after you, when you reach 5 stars, is enormous and never ending. You kill them all, and new wave of the same size appears, before you can run away. Physics seem to work on you mostly, but rest of the world is onl'y 50% simulated, therefore police will not only outrun you on 90 degree turns, motorways, and any streets (even heavy with traffic), then stop in a split second, coming out of the car with guns already shooting at you, and kill you very very quickly, if you only happen to slip or fall. And, they kill first, then ask questions. Developer support is the non-existent now. R* stopped listening to fans, and reports of problems. They just keep breaking the game further and further. No testing was done whatsoever, since the game release. Every single patch broke the game more and more in Single Player, only to patch small bugs in MP, which is bugged beyond belief. I can only spend a bit of time on weekends to play it so I didn't finish the game on SP yet, but it's no reason to break SP without care for those who are still playing it.

I bought this for my teenaged+ kids for Christmas, and I don't think I could have made a bigger mistake. The game itself is flawless. Smooth. Realism. Great looking. Great gameplay. The content is unforgivably offensive, to the point that a liberal like me- who leaps to the defense of the industry and rails against ratings and censorship online- I think I made a huge mistake as a parent. The good news? My kids came to me, because I get a little uptight with them when we buy a full priced new game and they either don't play it or blast through the main story on easy in a week, they came to me and told me they were too uncomfortable with the content to play it anymore. They did. I took a look at what was on by big ol' high def television, and all I can say is that it would have deserved a ""XXX"" rating in any other media genre. Disgusting. Profane. Racist. Violent in an anti-social and stomach-churning way. And some of the content is flat out pornography. Not even good pornography. The content reflects a version of ""reality"" that made each and every one of us ill, and now this game is going to Game Stop as a trade-in ASAP. Everyone seems to be in a big hurry to praise this game (and as usual you wonder how many reviewers actually played the WHOLE game, how many are mindless zombie fans, and how many are being paid for positive reviews), but Rockstar has gone way, way too far this time. Far enough that I'm flaming this game. Far enough that I'm going to become a supporter of game content censorship. Good work, guys. You turned me into a conservative on this matter. Far enough that I will not buy another Rockstar title ever again (I'm a PC gamer, anyway so no loss there for me. I'm sick of Rockstar's console developer **** anyway.) When the conservative folk want to censor an industry everyone complains. Everyone, including me. We definitely don't need game developers giving ammunition to the many folk that would love to see the whole thing go away. But, like I said, now I'm a supporter of censorship thanks to this one. Of course, the censorship will go too far one day also- but this industry will have no one to blame but themselves (actually, blame Rockstar.)

"The economy for GTA Online is disgustingly broken. This one fact overshadows the main story, and everything else. If I spend $60 on a game, I should not be shamelessly encouraged to dish out more for virtual cash. But that's what they do unfortunately... The prices for garages, apartments and cars are extremely outrageous. Well, unless you want a scummy-ass garage or apartment, you'll be paying an upwards of 400,000 in-game money. You also pay like a 50 to 200 in-game money hospital bill everytime you die, which is extremely annoying and pretty much forces you to buy the money packs if you want an enjoyable experience. The players online will show you no mercy, and I have been pointlessly gunned down for scraps of cash many times. There's passive mode which stops you from being shot or beat to death on foot, but it's literally useless because people can still run you over or kill you in your vehicle. The players that are dumb enough to pay real money for virtual money, will have tanks, helicopters, planes, you name it... They all exploit the power of the vehicles too, mercilessly gunning less privileged players down. This one player was even crying on the microphone because these idiots kept killing him and took all his money... That's really sad, but I guess that's the kind of image Rockstar wants to portray. It disgusts me and I will most likely never purchase a Rockstar product again. Bottom line: Micro-transactions don't belong in $60 games.

The bad: To buy all the properties in campaign you need something like 300 times the amount of money you'd accumulate during a normal game if you hadn't spent a dime on anything else. The worst: Online is completely broken. Rockstar is trying to make an IAP-based online game so they continually reduce payouts for the majority of activities. On top of this, they also refuse to balance out the tank, which every cheater immediately bought, and which is the only weapon (outside of the sniper rifle) to have hitscan shells, on top of being able to literally outrun any RPG or grenade launcher round shot at it even within a range for 30-50 feet! Even worse: The matchmaking simply doesn't work, you will spend possibly as much time in an evening trying to get into a game and staring at loading screens over and over and over, then you will actually playing the game unless you play for many many hours at a stretch and never leave a lobby once you find one. Forget getting together with your friends entirely.",2,XBOX 360
"VERY LINEAR missions and progression. Just a huge theme park to drive arround, it's fun, but when you're forced to torture a guy with multiple tools, I just turned off the console and never played it again.",1,XBOX 360
"If you were to look up the definition of overrated, you would find a picture of GTA V. All you do in this game is drive and shoot people, which is what you do in every other M rated game. People didn't even get the full game when it came out. When online was released, it was broken.",0,XBOX 360
"Again, GTA proves that it is an overrated franchise. The only bright spot of this game is the soundtrack honestly. The gameplay is lacking in my opinion, as it is same old, same old GTA (much like CoD is same old, same old), and the online is a complete disappointment. The story is a generic crime story, no surprise there. And, to nobody's surprise, the community is a complete joke. A bunch of trolls and Rockstar fanboys who yell indeterminable slurs at you anytime you attempt to criticize the game. GTA will always appeal to its community I guess, but for people looking to get into the franchise I do not recommend it.",4,XBOX 360
Single player campaign is annoying and does not include enough heists. I hated having to switch players as the only character I truly cared about was Michael. The multiplayer really ****. It lacks any proper menus to navigate through game types. You'd shouldn't have to play 10 hours of the same races or missions to unlock better content.,2,XBOX 360
"First, I should say this was the first GTA game I played. I originally wanted to play this because I had seen other people play it and the story and the missions looked interesting. Once I actually started playing the game, I was absolutely appalled by the controls. It was like trying to use an Xbox after I'd just had a lobotomy. Maybe that's the allure to some people, but I actually want to PLAY my games. The one thing this game has going for it is the music. That's some jazzy",1,XBOX 360
Yet another dissapointment this year. This game could have been so much more. crews are pointles. you'd have thought that gangwarfare between crews would have been staring them in the face? there are no features for crews whatsoever. missions are repetative at best. its extremely glitchy still. features missing that have been around since 2001,0,XBOX 360
"The game is fun and entertaining but is very broken. Buildings don't load until you are right at them, texture pops happen all the time and the online is completely broken. The story is the only thing saving this game and the main story at that. One of the side missions made me run around the desert for 5 miles for no earthly reason. Many of the achievements also don't register so you spend a few hours collecting things only to not get the achievement.",3,XBOX 360
"DO NOT! I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS RUBBISH ASS GAME. From the 12 hours it takes to dl to your system, to the items you worked hard for but are just ""missing"", and the saves you made when you go to level 20 but is no longer there, Rockstar entertainment has stooped as low as the creator of diablo 3 which up to date was worst release ever. If this starts to become a trend, game companies selling fake games we shall have to together and put them out of business. rockstar gobble a giant ****",1,XBOX 360
the game in its self isn't bad has some good story and the characters are well made but it has poor driving and codes all and all its a game with potential but due to these massive flaws its just not worth getting they also left out some good things they put in other games like the hydra fighter jet and replaced with with a normal less fun one that runs out of fuel can't say I'm impressed with it the big thing being its to easy to die in a crash I hit a car in a low speed and it nearly killed me at full health you spin out easy and its also hard to keep from bashing up the car so bad the wheels lock making it impossible tyo get away from even a 2 star wanted level,2,XBOX 360

"Most depressing game I've ever played. I had high hopes for the game after all the hype. The magazines etc must be kidding us! They have obviously just gone along with public opinion with their biased 'best game ever', and 'groundbreaking' reviews. I've seen better graphics, better gameplay, storylines etc elsewhere. This GTA thing has been done to death now...Drive around, shoot someone, steal some money, goto a clothes shop, buy a burger, swim around, use the **** naw nee naw, some (as the game puts it) swearing non stop YAAAAWWWWNNNNN....They just promote it to make money ...One big cash in. The game is rubbish! Ok so the latest GTA game, number 5... First off, EVERYTHING you do in this game takes AGES. This is very clearly a game for people with no life whatsoever. Installing the game takes ages, you will spend hours trying to be able to save the game because it throws you into one boring mission after another (which entails driving around a massive landscape that all looks the same in a boring car (which all steer the same)). You complete the mission which goes on and on with endless chit chat and a (as the game puts it), saying 'pus£y as£ motha£u£in homeboy hoe' and 'move chor bi$ch as% fatherfu&ker homey' and 'whut id it wit choo (and such things non-stop throughout the game). It will do your head in that much you would rather the main characters got killed instead. Just a bunch of idiot main characters with nothing about them to like. You will murder, steal etc and all the time not give a toss about the person you are playing as...Just pointless. The game is racist, sexist, full of filth, corruption and murder. It's seedy and depressing. It's not a true representation of real life at all. When have you ever heard a rea; 'coloured' guy talk like these idiots they dig out for games and movies? It's like having Samuel Sackson in die hard 3 and an angry coked-up Eggie Murphy shouting in your ear for hours on end... And again it's been done and been done better before. We had all this nonsense in San Andreas with 'CJ'. 'Hey dat man chillin in ma crib homey' stupid talking rubbish. Again; It's impossible to relate to the characters because they are rapists, idiots, thieves and murderers (and worse)...Just scum. The radio drives you off your head and how anyone with an actual real life can play this game I will never know....I mean it's so unnecessarly detailed you can even choose the ringtone on your fake phone in the game or take photos with the phones camera, check texts, messages online etc. It's just too much for a game. Fake girlfriends, fake friends etc etc. Wtf? Get a life folks! The strip club is a joke. I mean if they are going to have all that stuff why not just go the full hog and put in detailed sex etc instead of beating around the bush with a bit of **** here and there? The game is just a cop out. It can't even do the violence and sex thing right without shi&&ing out. As I said, EVERYTHING takes ages in this game. I went to play it online thinking ""I've got an hour to kill (before i went out to live in the real **** It went on and on and on with some coloured guy showing me around (another idiot) saying this, that, sh^& hoe bit&hin motha&^ka that for hours again, only to drop me somewhere in the world with more criminal activity to do as I controlled another lowlife (myself this time which i created with the character creation which is also totally rubbish (you pick your granny and grandad and their granny and grandad to get your looks). I played the game for a few hours (which was pretty good going) and after all the drugs, violence and utter boredom I was begging someone to take me into the shops to trade the (sh%t) game in...I couldn't wait! The main characters are cowards too which makes it even more unbearable and when angry go into little girlie hissy fits etc...They reminded me of wanabees on x factor getting told they can't sing and then they go all spotty and teenage and display their little temper tantrums....Just pathetic. I usually buy these games to drive around the virtual world with my steering wheel. On this game the wheel doesnt work (it works with every other car game). Nothing of use actually works in this game. Even the cheats are rubbish. No lock wanted level, nothing. Your forced to just play the dull, sick storyline. Who wants to play a game hearing throughout non-stop some bit$% as£ hoe, complain about their sad life all the way through a game? There are 3 characters in this game...3 whingers that do nothing but complain about their rubbish pathetic lives and see violence and behaving as an idiot as the only way out. They all have mental issues and see phychologists, take drugs, drink etc. Hardly a cheery game and not something I would pollute my mind with. I took this back to the shop the next day, sorry I ever bought it. Everything about this game bored me stupid",0,XBOX 360
I love this game it's one of the best i've ever played of and btw im here courtesy of OfficialNerdCubed break the system metacritic is ****! Anyways i think that the graphics are good looking they don't overdue it at ALL. The missions are awesome and the story is like a movie.,0,XBOX 360

It's poorly designed, with a stupid 3-heroes gameplay and primitive, but damaging role-playing system, Cars in this game are steering so badly, that it's be better if there is was no cars at all!

This game is generally good but I hate the fact that all women are walking around with 10 lbs of cleavage on their pencil thin bodies. Most of the time the game is great.,1,XBOX 360
"In all honesty, I tried to play this game, and I tried... I tried so hard... and what ended up happening was that I was greeted with multiple segments of ""avoid damage and drive safely"" which to me is just a big step down. It was Driving Simulator 2014 I swear to god. A game is meant to catch the attention within the first hour. I know that the game can get fun, but all the things that you have to do to lead up to that fun is just not worth it. I'll admit I loved the past few games, but they were fun, it threw you into the action, this is just driving along a road avoiding other cars.",0,XBOX 360
"To start off, I'll review this game in one word: shallow. The word rings true while calling to mind any and all facets of the game. A story that masquerades as compelling until it is quickly forced to open up and reveal its hollow interior, gameplay stuck on seemingly perpetual repeat, and dozens of elements that were clearly thrown in only for purposes of making the game look more expansive than it really is. I suppose some of my irritation comes not only from the game but from the way it was marketed. Biggest map ever? Only if you include the miles of sand and rocks that make up the game's underwater sections. Intense interactive heist missions? Only one can truly fit that description, while the others only do the bare minimum required to somewhat pass off as such. The world is no doubt impressive, but ultimately comprised of too much filler and wasted opportunity. So much of the world is incredibly detailed but ultimately useless and boring, and every time you come across an area that has the potential to defy that pattern, Rockstar has decided to neglect it (presumably to release it in a dlc pack later on). Really? The racetrack and CASINO (among other locales) are useless shells while i can go into a 7-11 and look at low-res cereal boxes? Sure, I can hold up the 7-11 for a comically small amount of money, which is nice considering the other 90% of stores you can't hold up, despite the creators frequently flaunting the new robbery mechanic. As far as the other new gimmicky mechanics, no amount of customization can spice up the relentlessly simple gameplay, which seems determined to etch itself into your head through gross repetition. Of course it's not all bad. The writing is often clever and the earlier missions are definitely creative, which stand in stark contrast to the last few missions, which feel more like side missions and hold about the same narrative weight. I also found the game quite funny, while my friend found it about as funny typhus, so I'd imagine his score to be even lower. The soundtrack is extensive and there are some fun side activities, but ultimately nothing that can save this game from the grave it started digging the moment they started marketing. There is just not enough to do once the story mode is completed, and that which there is feels more like a grind than a fun mechanic. You can't tell me navigating a poorly controlled submarine in miles of nothingness for an hour and a half, JUST to get a stupid collectible, is fun. You just cant! So please stop using mundane collectibles as a means to say ""There is so much to do in this game omgggg!"" There are several other small gripes I have with the game (such as the fact that they showed video of planes spewing toxic pesticides only to cheat us out of that actually fun mechanic) but I won't go into any more, as they come off as nit-picky. -Now, as I near the conclusion of my review, and many of you cry butthurt pc fanboy, let me say that I played this on 360 and am quite familiar with the GTA series. I'm not comparing this to a deep emotional experience like heavy rain, I'm comparing it to what GTA claims to be, and has succeeded at being in previous installments. A satirical sandbox with an entertaining story and mechanics that add to either the mood or enjoyment of the game. What you will find in GTA V is a dull story, shallow side activities and mechanics, and a city which has much more flare than substance. Also before I go i feel obligated to talk about gta's online feature. I don't even know where to begin with GTA Online. It's a glitch ridden mess, which encourages the complete opposite of what makes gta fun. It would've been much more accurate if they called it ""Responsible Money Manager 2013 Where You Are Penalized For Committing Grand Theft Auto and Shamelessly Encouraged to Buy GTA Dollars Through the Online Store"". Yuck. Online Freemode used to be such a chaotic and fast paced experience, and I couldn't have thought of a better way to ruin it myself. Obviously none of these criticisms are relevant if you can't even get in, or are unlucky enough to have all of your progress deleted, as is the case with thousands of users. Well, I hope this review helped to save you some money. If only I had read a realistic review before I dropped my precious $60.",0,XBOX 360
"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the Rockstar's masterpiece. The other games that came after are crap. They lost a great oportunity to make a great epic like San Andreas, but they ruined it.

I hope that Rockstar relaunch the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with improved graphics and the new shotter mechanics.",2,XBOX 360
GTA online is Total utter changed my score from an 8 to a 0 just because of how bad online is and the lack of community communication by rockstar of how they are going to address these issues. the fanboy's if you put a EA logo on this game instead of a R* one people would be losing their Probably rioting outside their office.

"Killed the entire franchise. Halo 3 had over 1.5 million active players a year after launch, with Reach maintaining roughly a million in the same time frame, despite COD’s takeover. Halo 4 debuted with a million players and had under 10 thousand when it hit it’s one year mark. That’s how bad this game is, and the franchise will never fully recover. And no, the campaign isn’t “half bad”. It’s embarrassing.",2,XBOX 360
"I do not like this game at all. The campaign is an attempt to rekindle the series that had been beautifully capped at the end of Halo 3, which was never needed. Sure, I can see why some people like the story, I just don't see at as appealing personally. The game looks like every late-era xbox 360 game, dull and washed, a blur of green and grey most of the time. A few decent set pieces doesn't save half the game looking bad. But Halo 4's biggest sin is it's multiplayer. It takes a perfected formula, and turns it into Call of Duty. No equal starts, weapons avaliable in loadouts being so broken you would think it would be a power weapon. Map layout knowledge is also gone because of markers and weapon drops that completely ruin the games arena shooter roots.",2,XBOX 360

Cause yeah , on paper and in art of an action fallout 4 is worse than the other fallouts , but in the end its a great game and it is in my favourites . But when it comes to halo ... dude . Halo 4 **** , i cant even think of tthis game as a halo : AI is stupid as hell ( which is already turns it into a pickle , cause smartass ai is the main thing that makes halo better , harder , and smarter than the other shooter games even now days ) , graphics is not bad specially for xbox 360 but dude the display is 1990 even the CE didnt had that bad one , in other halos the gameplay was so impactfull u had a lot of different guns enemies and cars which u can use ( the same thing was in halo 4 but they were giving it to u rarely and not in the time it was funny or something , so u can see that its not bungie were creating a game ) . There actually is the hing which makes game a little better - story . Idk i think all the didact and forerunners ark were AWESOME ! And i also liked that in the end it took a lot more dark tuen . It reminded me of previous games that did the same thing but better . Also multiplayer was nice cause u know , i like halos 3 mp better but as a zoomer i cant lie that i liked new graphics and shooting little more . But in the end the game kinda **** , and i am a zoomer so its really shows HOW BAD game is . Cause nowdays games consumed by zoomers are even worse , and even known that fact game is still pretty bad ! So thats why i am excited for halo infinite , through the trailers and leaks it looks a more like old games !",0,XBOX 360

Halo 4 is a good game yes but the thing is that u think that they should let you pick what gender you want to be and not just be a man from the start. yes there are girls in the game but they don't really do much they are not in the battlefield and a women is one of the cause of the problem. I think that if it was a men then you would see it from a different perspective .,0,XBOX 360
"Halo, What a great series! I feel in love with Halo for it's story, music and solid FPS gameplay. It's similar to Half-life in that way. A Great FPS story-driven game. Sadly, 343i decided to throw the story out of the window. The plot in Halo 4 is there to justify the visuals and that's it. it's contrived and lazy. It doesn't respect Halo lore that came before it. It a sad day when something you love becomes a cash cow. (Looking at you SW: Force Awakens). Halo 4 is a beautiful game, can't take that away, sure. BUT it falls flat on it's face in every other aspect. Adding sprint and crouch doesn't count as innovative gameplay. It's the worst kind of action flick. It goes for dazzling beauty with big ""epic"" scenes with little sense. The campaign which is the main reason Halo is such an awesome beloved series is the weakest part of this game. The Good: - Beautiful - Sprint/Crouch The Bad: - Soundtrack - Story *Doesn't take a genius to see that most 9-10 reviews are simply fan-boys. some would even say the campaign/story isn't that good but still give it a 10.",4,XBOX 360

"I hate to use the word ""overrated"" but that may be the best way to describe Halo 4. Campaign: I hesitate to call Halo 4's campaign a mixed bag as the bad outweighs the good by a notable margin in my opinion. Halo 4's story is good and the ending is genuinely emotional (at least if you played it before Halo 5 came out) but the gameplay often falls flat on its face. But before we get to that lets address the elephant in the room, the art style change. This game looks awful in comparison to Halo 3 and its all because 343 decided to change Bungie's art style. Master Chief looks 3x as bulky as he did previously, elites look and sound brutish and dumb, grunts are too ugly, Cortana is overly sexualized, Forerunner structures are overly detailed and boring, so on and so forth. Now onto gameplay. Halo 4's campaign has two main problems: stupid cinematic QTE moments that ruin pacing and serve as the final boss, and the Prometheans. The Prometheans replace the Flood in Halo 4 and they're boring bullet sponges with only one strategy for taking them down. Shoot them till they die. The crawlers are the only good ones because they go down with a single headshot and they're satisfying to kill. The Covenant are fine but brutes, drones and skirmishers are gone. This game is also a complete trainwreck on legendary. You also get to fly a pelican but it **** because you only fight phantoms. The soundtrack is pretty good, though some tracks feel a little too much like Star Wars or Mass Effect rather than Halo. Multiplayer: The multiplayer is terrible. Halo 4's multiplayer has customisable loadouts with perks and really bad killstreaks that are just power ups and power weapons. All the returning armour pieces look inferior to Reach's and only a handful of the new ones are decent. Honestly, the multiplayer is so boring that its not even worth talking about in detail but I will say that forge **** and so does the physics engine. Spartan Ops: Spartan Ops is Firefight's replacement. Its pretty much just a longer campaign and it suffers from all the same problems except here you get to to play as your own spartan, earn XP, and can respawn infinitely regardless of difficulty. Theres not much more I can say about except that it has a decent story and really good cutscenes. Overall, Halo 4 is an incredibly disappointing game and I would go as far as to say its bad. Though I will give it credit for one thing: it snapped me out of my Halo fanboyism.",4,XBOX 360
"No merce nor a poor 3, The game is boring and monotonous, the levels are poorly made, the artificial intelligence coverings and the placement of weapons are bad, The music is not very good although it has two or three tracks that are quite good The others scratch the absurd, and the story is very badly told, I feel it could have been better, even spartan ops has a better story. I put a zero because I refuse to accept this as a halo.",0,XBOX 360
Halo 3 tied all the loose ends in the Halo lore together then halo 4 throws that knot in a blender and gives it the middle finger.Also i found the multilayer to be mediocre and the forge is no where near as good as the forge in other halo games ive played and completed every single halo but im not planning on purchasing 343's next halo game.,0,XBOX 360
"I had never been more hyped for a game in my life. And I have also never been so let down. Halo 4 delivered something that made me feel like I was playing call of duty with Halo weapons. Where did they go wrong? To start things off I can honestly say that Halo 4's multiplayer reminded me of a CoD game. It seems that 343 was trying to emulate some of the features like sprinting and custom classes into this game, which did not work. Speaking of things that did not work there is that ever so simple ranking system that lacked creativity and sense of accomplishment. 1,2,3,4,5........... Ranks going by numbers to me was always something I hated. It took absolutely no skill to even level up, all you had to do was play the game unlike Halo 4's older brother Halo 3 where skill was implemented into your overall rank. But overall the multiplayer was bland and I quickly lost interest in all of the new abilities and gadgets. Ahhh forge, probably the most bittersweet aspect of the game. Halo 4's forge introduced great new abilities like the ""snap"" feature which I absolutely loved. It also introduced some great maps to build on as well as tons of options to forge with. However that does not save it from it's errors. Dissapointment stuck me hard when I found that there was no UNSC flying vehicle. Only thing that was even capable of flying was a banshee. But that is nothing compared to that annoying intolerable ""generating lighting"" screen that pops up when you exit the forge ball. Now I am not sure about you guys but this completely killed my love for forge. Even though it was those few seconds I had to wait after only a few minutes of trying to build something I couldn't take it anymore. It was just so annoying. The campaign. I am actually completely neutral on this one. I did not think the campaign did an amazing or terrible job of moving along the story, I just think it moved it along. The game play during this was fun I must say but it didn't truly catch my eye. So with this I score Halo 4 a 4/10. It was an extreme let down to me personally and I really hope that 343 doesn't screw up with Halo 5.",4,XBOX 360
"As a major fan of the Halo franchise, I was extremely excited for this game, as at the time of it's announcement Halo 3 was (and still is) one of my favorite games ever made. So, how did 343i do witha follow up? Horribly. The game feels like a clone of Call of Duty, with aspects of Metroid Prime, and some ideas from Halo past. The game starts with Master Chief waking up from cryo-stasis, as shown in Halo 3 and Halo Legends. He then finds out from Cortana that she found an odd planet. A couple of minutes later, they find out the planet is of Promethean origin. I'll leave it there, in case anyone reading this wants to play it. As for the multiplayer, this is where the aforementioned Call of Duty kicks in. The game now relies upon a customized load-out system that you make yourself for multiplayer. While the idea is nice, it was poorly executed, as there are not as many weapons or customization options in Halo, making it feel to flat. In addition, there are now rewards for getting a bunch of points in a row. Sound familiar? Because it is extremely similar to the Kill-Streak system from Call of Duty, except in this you chose between a power up, weapon, or armor ability. In all, Halo 4 was a major disappointment to me and, according to the user score, many others. 4/10 is the highest I could give this game.",4,XBOX 360
"Dear all, after recently giving in to try 343s recreation of the Halo FPS and playing halo since the first game I think it is worth giving a review of this somewhat lacking game. First of all the campaign story feels unremarkable and has certainly lost some of the implied scale of the previous trilogy, quick time events, an unremarkable antagonist and a plot held together by string all work to undermine all the Story of the game. Each character acts to break immersion from the game, for example the librarian tells the Masterchief that she planned his coming many millenia ago, now this breaks the story, how can one individual anticipate the multitude of factors over those years, both genetic and environmental, acting as everything is predetermined undermines the entire experience and makes you want to put down the controller. Captain Del Rio is a complete jackass and the MasterChief licks his boots like some dog, it seemed like 343 forget that this game is meant to fulfill the gamers needs and wants and not be this quasi realistic drama where Cortana, a character I loved to hate in all previous titles, is humanised, I couldn't care for her before and especially don't now. Spartan Ops is repetitive on the same five maps and offers nothing new to the franchise, both it and the campaign seem to be very similar: Go here, Press X, Kill enemies, Press X, Listen to female narration and terrible commentary, end scene. Multiplayer is unbalanced and far from previous Halos Arena style combat, Everything needs to be more competitive. Upon writing this review I have completed this game solo on legendary, have a 1.9 K/D on War Games and completed every Spartan Ops episode that came with game. My final point is this: it seems like Halo 4 brings an end to the creativity of previous Halo titles, and fails to make an emotional impact unlike Halo Reach. I would say this game is regression to the generic first person shooter and not what Halo is, after sinking many hours into this game I can say it is worth a play and is fun but do not expect the same re playability the older games offered.",4,XBOX 360
"Halo 4 is, on its' own, a decent game. However, as a Halo game, it doesn't match up to its' predecessors. The gameplay is more or less solid, to its' credit, but 343 thoroughly butchers the lore of the universe for Halo 4 as well as in the novels surrounding it. Considering the barely tolerable characters like Sarah Palmer, whom is essentially a misogynistic Sergeant Johnson wannabe, the plot is incredibly cringeworthy, both for Spartan Ops and campaign, with lore issues as well as the cringeworthy acting for the ""romance"" or whatever nonsense that Chief and Cortana get into. Multiplayer is pretty solid in the basics but gets to be pretty awful when you interact with any of the call of dutyied game systems added in like prestiege armors or whatever the garbage is that they added. Multiplayer armor designs are also some of the worst ever, resembling power rangers more than military hardware. Most of the helmets have **** visor designs, or look like wannabe copies of Recon helmets. Mix in the bizzare lack of a codplate and loads of greeble-ey design work and you get armor that generally looks awful. Overall, better off renting this game if you can, cause it's not worth buying for any long term interest.",4,XBOX 360
"I've played previous Halo games that I enjoyed, but this one is not very good. Levels were boring, no new features or game perks. The AI was predictable, and after figuring that out the missions became easy to finish.",4,XBOX 360
"This was a great game. However the reason that i am giving this game such a low review is because they got rid of firefight!!! Me and my sister had hours of fun through the halo series playing firefight!!! If spartan opp is the same thing then it still stinks because i just cant play it. I have to get Xbox live or something. I don't like this because of what happened after the update. I got sent back to sr1 after updating!!!! This ruined the game for me. Also during forge, there was a problem. I would be in forge mode and then i would turn back to spartan but i would take forever to make the screen load back.That was annoying. after i got sent back to recruit, i stopped playing this game. Not cool 343. not cool.",3,XBOX 360
"By far and large the worst Halo game I've ever played. It's definitely in the top 5 worst shooters I have ever played. I loved Halo Reach and made sure to pre-order this game. It looked like it had promise. Know who else looked like they had promise? ****. And look what happened because of him. Halo 4 is a broken, boring pathetic mess that isn't worthy of a 0/10. The story is predictable, the final boss is.... a single quick time even that gives you 20 seconds to press the button, the controls handle like ass, and the game runs like it was programmed on Windows 95. Sure, it has great graphics, but its horrid aesthetic makes it look like the fantasies of a bisexual 13 year old brony. I'm not kidding when I say that it took longer to install the **** game than it did to melt the disk in my microwave. Not gonna be buying another 343 game after this pathetic **** mess. The campaign is at least acceptable, but dear god.. The multiplayer. Halo has always thrived on being a unique experience. Thus, the ""Combat Evolved"" part of the first Halo's name. Now, it's more like ""Halo: Call of duty RippedOff."" Know why? It's a Call of Duty clone with a sci-fi skin, but it has vehicles. Unbalanced vehicles that are easily stronger than 7 assault rifles in one. Need proof? A railgun mounted truck than can instantkill almost any other vehicle from the end of the map with splash damage the size of a tank shell. The guns all have no recoil, they are 3-4 hit kills but fire way too fast, sniper rifles are overpowered as **** there is a ""killstreak"" in the form of ordinance drops containing... more overpowered weapons! It's Space CoD but badly executed. The matchmaking is worse than Titanfall's, as you'll have a team of level 1's up against a team of level 130's. This isn't mentioning the hackers, either. Over the course of 5 games, I saw 8 hackers. 1 noclipper, 3 godmoders, 2 people spawning in weapons or items and 2 who just nuked the map. That's **** PATHETIC. The soundtrack is a generic orchestra track ripped straight from Silence of the Lambs. I have sincerely seen flash games with better music. Spartan Ops, which is essentially just the campaign that removes story in order to make you move from point A to point B and shoot **** I learned more about Halo's backstory from one 3 minute cut scène than I did the entire 10 hour session of Spartan Ops. Here's a bit of a TL;DR Graphics: 7/10. Great graphics but ****ty aesthetic. I think this was the best part of the game. Story: 6/10. Generic and boring BUT innovative and new. Gameplay: 3/10. Go here, shoot thing. Nothing beyond this besides the occasional vehicle section with horrible controls. The UNSC vehicles feel like the tires are made out of liquid nitrogen, and the Covenant vehicles feel like there are no longer laws of physics. There are no forerunner vehicles, sadly. 343 was too cheap and just decided to rip all of its vehicles out of Reach, except for the aforementioned overpowered railgun truck of death. Multiplayer: 000/10. One zero wasn't enough to describe this **** mess. ****ty matchmaking that has you waiting for 10 minutes to find a game among 3000 other players (it tells you how many people are online in a specific gamemode) repetitive and boring gameplay where the semi-auto and burst guns are overpowered, any explosive is ridiculously overpowered and sniper rifles are gamebreaking, overpowered vehicles, nonexistent objectives besides ""Take this flag! It will help the UNSC cause for some reason."" I think Modern Warfare 3 did multiplayer better. This is inexcusable. Dialogue: 6/10. No real complaints. A lot of the lines sounded like they were made by a 2 year old, but halo isn't about dialogue. We're here to kill aliens like the space KKK. Soundtrack: 4/10. It works. It fits decently, but it isn't very good. That's basically it. I'd take any FPS game over this pitiful excuse **** made by a company that doesn't give a damn about its customers. -Someone whose favorite console is the Xbox 360. (If this were ported to PC, it'd get an 8/10. Less hackers, better controls, better frame rate, better community. You name it, PC could do it better.) You know, I loved the first two halos to death. I personally think Halo: Combat Evolved is a **** masterpiece. So, I was disappointed to find that ODST was better than this. And ODST was some shiiiiit. I'll have to do my research before I buy into another Halo game. That, and hope I don't get matched up against a squad of hackers and a squad of people playing Halo 24/7.",0,XBOX 360
"What a disappointment, I've been a long time Halo fan, and in my honest opinion this is the worst in the series. Yes Halo Wars is better than this crap. The graphics and gameplay are save this game other than that I wouldn't play this. If they didn't change the Flood game mode I would have given this game a 5 because Flood was where I spent most of my time until they added the saw, assault rifle and more to the mix because then what's the challenge this game just ****",3,XBOX 360
"It would go faster to just write the positive aspects of this game because that list is very short. Generally good visuals, a lot of weapons to choose from, some new and fresh enemies. That's pretty much all that i can think of as positive. This game feels so cheap and just poorly made especially if you have in mind the budget they've had for making this game, they had the chance to make a splendid sequel which in my opinion is something they failed very very bad at. There are so many aspects which are full of flaws. Items and weapons disappear out of nowhere, once you drop a weapon or if a enemy drop a weapon it disappear if you turn your back away, it even happens while it's on screen. There is no depth in the story and it kind of doesn't feel like halo at all. The game is very repetitive and also very short, sometimes it feels like they've used the same maps but just rearranged some things. In Spartan Ops is the same maps but just playing them in reverse. The respawn system in Spartan Ops is also crap, you literally respawn where you die which puts you in a spawn kill loop where you are surrounded with knights that simply kill you once you respawn and i just laughed at how poorly made this game is. You can't hijack banshees which i tried on several missions which also adds up on the negatives. When you buy the game, the only thing that is available is the campaign. Spartan Ops and all other things in Halo 4 requires Gold membership which is **** So technically when you buy the game you only get to play the short campaign and if you wanna play more you have to pay monthly to do so. I looked forward to Halo 4 and looked upon 343 industries as a new chapter who had the possibility to fix all the bad stuff with the previous games like the bad AI for instance, but instead they kept all the bad stuff and added some more just for the fun of it. I feel awkward on behalf of 343 industries who, with all the resources, people and finances to release such a disaster. I have been a fan of halo series and was really hoping for improvement but this is the end of the line for me. I'm not buying any other Halo games in the future, there are SO many better games to spend your money on which won't make you feel robbed.",0,XBOX 360
"Game was bad felt like I was in a Micheal Bay Movie, ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd",0,XBOX 360
"To all of you giving ""heartfelt"" tens, I honestly cannot say I agree with you. I feel like your sheer amount of overhype for this game made it ""good"" for you. As a devoted Halo fanboy, I feel justified in my reasons to not like the game. Yes, the graphics quality was decent. That's basically the only thing I can hand this game. The soundtrack, story, characters, and multiplayer didn't feel like Halo. In my honest opinion, having Chief be that outspoken really didn't fit his original ""silent/speaks when he has to"" persona. The story was short and unsweet and really betrayed the previous games and the canon in general. For one, the Covenant aren't supposed to be back! They were defeated in Halo 3, if anybody even paid attention. Sure, there could be rogues running around, but they wouldn't be ELITES of all things in their ranks! It's like a freakin' time paradox. It simply shouldn't have happened. Also, the fact that the Forerunner, Didact, was still alive, goes against all of the lore and backstory that Bungie built up, and that just doesn't sit well with me. The death of Cortana was a predictable cliche that we all knew was going to happen eventually, especially since half the Halo fanbase knew Cortana reached seven years of service in Halo 3. There also were a few plotholes, but what videogame doesn't have at least a tiny one? All in all, it didn't even get close to the privilege of licking the boot heels of Bungie's masterpieces.",0,XBOX 360
"While it wears the Brand 'Halo' on it, it really just feels like an 'okay' game. The single player mode didn't meet my expectations. Other than a few parts in the single player, the campaign was really boring and forgettable with no noteworthy locations that caught my eye(unlike the previous halo games, this was a first). It's obvious that microsoft is pushing for this to be an 'online experience' by locking away the spartan ops campaign only to those who have an xbox live subscription just rubs me the wrong way since the game lists it even though I haven't signed on Xbox live in months. I really feel like I didn't get my moneys worth this this title and since half of the single player experience is locked away because of microsofts greed I don't plan on purchasing another halo title until this predicament is sorted out, which judging by microsoft's obvious greed it will never happen...",0,XBOX 360
"I believed the hype IGN said about the newest Halo game, calling it the best Halo yet! Hype works people, it really does and they know it. The hype got to me so bad that I ignored one of the most obvious things there is to this game, it is not made by Bungie. Hype works even better on people who don't have what it takes to spot all the terrible flaws that certain product can have, in this case, Halo 4. Everything that made you a Halo fan is not to be found in this new entry to the franchise. This game is terrible, a true stinker. Bungie must be pretty angry for what they have done to their creation. After only two days, I traded this turd back to Gamestop, kept the case though, it's the only cool thing about this new Halo.",1,XBOX 360
"I have been playing Halo since Halo: Combat Evolved... Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this game! Do not listen to the positive reviews. 343i just killed the multiplayer, ""CoD-ifying"" it to steal players from its rivaling game, while the Halo player-base was awaiting for something to surpass Halo 3. However, not only did 343i fail in obtaining a CoD-like player-base, but they also managed to lose and disappoint many loyal fans of Halo.",0,XBOX 360
"This game absolutely kills the Halo franchise by not only killing the Halo story but ruining everything else in the story. All of the guns were redone but the UNSC weapons are completely useless, and it gets better, the new Forerunner weapons are a copy paste of the UNSC weapons with little to no good atributes. The story is too emotional for a Halo game and the threat of Cortana dieing is the worst part. The final boss completely kills the game because instead of the Halo 3 boss battle or the newer Halo Reach standoff, guess what all of the fans get? A **** quick time event that completely kills the Franchises amassing endings. Hey, do you like being able to customize your equipment and change your symbol? Well to bad because the new multiplayer function doesn't allow you to customize it, unless, you level up which if you have no friends to play with or now Xbox live gold, is hard, you better like that armor you're wearing.",2,XBOX 360
"This game completely shocked me, It was a massive disappointed, going from halo 3 to halo 4, it was like chalk and cheese. The maps had no depth to them and the online game play was very average. I gave it such a low rating because of how good the prequel was. Halo 3 10/10 ----> Halo 4 4/10 Hopefully halo 5 will redeem the series otherwise I will not be buying an xbox 1 as that is the only exclusive I am interested in",4,XBOX 360
"The Halo series we know and love is dead. Halo 4 is just a Call of Duty clone. With a 6 hour campaign and no Firefight Mode. The campaign is not creative at all. Promethean's talk about a Mass Effect rip off. It's funny and sad that Halo has to copy other game to be good now. Years ago it was the other way around. Half of this game is locked for online play which is very dumb, Pay to win OK.........errrrr No!. Spartan Op's ****. Thanks 343 for ruining one of my favourite game series. I'm very surprised this game is getting good reviews, don't listen to them this game is trash. No real Halo fan would accept this pile of ****. I'm going back to playing the infinitely superior Halo: Reach and Halo Combat Evolved.",0,XBOX 360

One of the best puzzles and ingenuity games that can be played to the present,9,PC
"Very short and more of a tech demo or proof of concept for its later sequel, but obviously massively impactful on gaming as a whole and on gaming culture. Initial dawning realisation that GLaDOS is sentient and malevolent, and when you first escape the boundaries of the testing chamber, were amazing. I'll never understand why lines like ""The cake is a lie"" became the over-memed repeated jokes when there are infinitely funnier and cleverer pieces of dialogue in this game, but so it goes.",8,PC
"Portal is a timeless classic that introduced revolutionary puzzle mechanics and an unforgettable atmosphere, combining minimalist graphics with the hilarious, sinister presence of GLaDOS. Its gameplay encourages creative problem-solving, offering a unique experience in each test chamber. Despite its short length, the game remains highly rewarding, with additional challenges that push players' skills. The impact of Portal on game design is immense, influencing countless titles and spawning a brilliant sequel. Even years later, it remains one of the most well-crafted and influential games in history.",10,PC

I just finished Portal and love it. It is short game but if you are busy and dont have much time to spend it is good for you. The game lasted 3 hours.Game mechanics made me suprised because i have not seen this concept before. It is 2025 and the game is still entertaining. You should give a chance.,9,PC

"I wanted to try it in 2024 because it was one of the classics. And i must say although the start was a bit slow, the games was really fun. Very creative job for just a simple mechanic. My score is an 8 because the game is as i said a bit slow at the start, but the end is really good. The community is healthy and if i played this in 2007 I would rate it a 9.",8,PC
"Portal is actually a very nice game, compared to other Valve games where adrenaline is high, it is a calm game and it is about solving puzzles. The puzzles are also easy. However, there is something like this. It is not enough to understand some levels. In some places, you have to hit the portal at such an angle that it makes a level a torture.

"Portal is a game that pleasantly surprised me from the first moment.Although I had already heard about him, I had never tried it before, and I must say that he left me impressed with his innovative approach in the **** that attracted me the most was how the game constantly challenged me to think creatively to overcome the levels.Each puzzle was like a fresh challenge, inviting me to explore different solutions and strategies to make my way through the portals **** Well, history is not the central point of the game, it provides an interesting background and complements the general experience.Although simple, add depth to the world of the game and provide context to the tests you face as **** Simple visual style but captivating fits perfectly with game mechanics.Although the game is already a few years old, its graphics still support themselves and contribute to an enveloping experience and **** As for the duration, it is true that the game is relatively short and took me less than 4 hours to complete it.However, every moment was a rewarding experience and left me wanting more, anxious to immerse me in the **** summary, Portal is a game that challenges you to think creatively while immersing you in a world of portals and puzzles.Although the story is simple, it complements the game experience, and its exceptional gameplay will surely leave the players wanting more.I can't wait to try portal 2 and continue exploring this fascinating universe!",9,PC

"The portal is not afraid to say a great game in the history of Valve.I dreamed about this game for a long time, although I already knew the plot and saw the passage of nothing from it was prevented by the game of extremely interesting, I won’t forget to say about local physics, it is realized perfectly for my age, we will not forget what year this game, as well as a fan of old games, expected a more bad graphics, although it would be better for Bioshok or S.T.T.T.T.T.L.K.E.The developers tried on the physics of portals.Personally, I went through the game in five hours, I had to suffer about some puzzles, although in principle they weren’t too complicated, just like an inattentive person often missed the eyes of some small details, hints, etc.But still I liked the game.I recommend it all the more now at a discount (at the time of writing) a mechanic in the game is a little, a feature too, but there is something to have fun, they will not get bored and complicated rooms.But unfortunately, you can have little fun with him, Cuba Portals, Tounds, Platforms, Modern Players buttons will like little, but passing the game is worth the plot and most importantly atmosphere.You will not leave the feeling of loneliness and claustrophobia, as if you are locked here.You, like the main character, will be happy to get out and see people real and living, for this people pass Portal, for the atmosphere.And on this review comes to an end and yes, if you want to continue, remember that there is a second part of the game, but unfortunately it also costs not little money without a discount.",10,PC

puzzle and story is great. Makes me think twice. but graphic is so-so. Because it came out in 2007.,10,PC
Best Puzzle Game Ever,10,PC
"Portal, released in 2007, is a triumph of game design, creativity, and wit. This puzzle-platformer, set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories, delivers an experience that is not only groundbreaking but also unforgettable. Portal's innovation in gameplay and storytelling sets it apart as a true masterpiece of the medium. At its core, Portal is a deceptively simple concept: players are armed with the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, a gun that can create linked portals on specific surfaces. This ingenious mechanic forms the foundation of the game's puzzles, turning each room into a mind-bending spatial challenge. The gradual introduction of new elements and mechanics keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting throughout. What makes Portal truly remarkable is its storytelling. The game's antagonist, GLaDOS, is an AI with a sinister sense of humor that slowly reveals itself as players progress. The witty and darkly comedic script, combined with GLaDOS's increasingly erratic behavior, creates a sense of unease and intrigue that drives the narrative. The player character, Chell, is a silent protagonist, but her journey is told through environmental storytelling and the interactions with the AI. This minimalist approach to storytelling allows players to piece together the narrative and engage on a deeper level. Portal's level design is nothing short of brilliant. Each chamber is a meticulously crafted puzzle that challenges players to think critically and creatively. The satisfaction that comes from solving these puzzles is immensely rewarding. The pacing is spot-on, introducing new challenges at just the right moments. The game's presentation is clean and sterile, fitting the aesthetic of Aperture Science Laboratories. The sterile environment contrasts with the chaos and intrigue that unfolds as players delve deeper into the facility. The ambient sound design and eerie music contribute to the game's unique atmosphere. Portal's brevity may be its only drawback, as it can be completed in a relatively short time. However, its compact experience is a testament to its quality, and it encourages replayability and speedrunning. In conclusion, Portal is a groundbreaking masterpiece that showcases the power of innovative gameplay and storytelling in video games. Its clever puzzles, darkly comedic narrative, and minimalist presentation make it a must-play for gamers and a shining example of what the medium can achieve.",10,PC
Good classic game to think.,8,PC
"Portal is an incredible gameplay concept, that had an incredible game built around it. The story and pacing are good, the jokes are funny, and holy **** that 3rd act is something else Incredible game 9.5/10",9,PC
Just a fun game puzzle with a fun story. Really not anything to dislike. Well done,9,PC
"The villain makes this game prefect. Not gonna tell you much about the villain. But I will tell you that this game is a simple masterpiece. The test chambers in this game are pretty good. If it's a Valve game... YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. There's only really like 2 Valve games that are bad. This low count of bad games makes them the King of gaming (I'm looking at YOU 343). This game is not very story driven. That's not a bad thing for me. But if that's a bad thing for you, then you might not like Portal 1. This game is a game you should play before you die.",10,PC
"Valve really needs to make more new games with their IPs man. Portal has one of the most unique and creative concepts for a game I've ever seen, and the potential this series has is through the roof. The execution of those ideas, while flawed in a few ways, still made for an excellent experience, and I can confidently say that even with only two games, Portal is one of my favorite series. While the first game does suffer from the campaign being too short, along with a couple of bugs here and there, those are nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. The puzzles feel so satisfying to complete, the level design is very impressive, and character/story wise, it's actually a really funny game. Both games in the Portal series excel at what they do, and while Portal 2 has more depth and is way more replayable these days, you shouldn't count out the first game under any circumstance.",9,PC
"Best puzzle game I've ever played, even if not that hard. Portal is just amazing and I think every gamer should give it a try.",10,PC

"A short game, but entertaining from beginning to end, an ingeniously designed portals mechanics, with an open end more than decent.If you want more, there is its sequel, so the duration of the game, despite being its greatest point against, can easily be remedied.An addictive game, which will not make you take off from the screen until you finish",9,PC
Just text (crutch) to save the game to the list. Such things. Maybe I'll do a review later.,9,PC
The best puzzle game ever made and yet again it reminds me of the golden days of gaming when valve actually made games...,9,PC

In quality-price it is the best you can buy.He has a more innovative and fun idea.It is not very long but it is worth it.,9,PC
It is a clear piece of work that showcases the mechanics and modernity of the Source engine. It is a game that must be played by those who love puzzle games.,10,PC
"Glados has more character and personality than 99% of peoples i met in my life, pure short masterpiece",9,PC
"Great puzzle game, thoroughly enjoyed almost every moment, some puzzles here are more frustrating than challenging, however, mostly due to the pretty wacky physics engine. Overall it's a great, simple puzzle game, that is merely overshadowed by just how much of a sheer masterpiece its sequel is.",8,PC
"Excellent video game.This puzzle game based on the use of portals is revolutionary, being very entertaining to play;If we add to this a very good narrative and such a charismatic villain, the perfect combination arises.",9,PC
"(Review taken from my Steam account: Apolchrome) Portal is a masterpiece.When I started playing it, I did not understand why of the good reviews of the game.The beginning is very simple and when I say very, it is very simple.But, each time the game became better.Each puzzle is more difficult than the previous one, with an idea that is very simple and at the same time complex (such as using two portals to go to different sites), which is used greatly during 19 levels.The story is simple (not bad, it is quite original) but the best is undoubtedly its villain: glados.GLADOS is one of the best antagonists I've seen in a long time, because he only loves you to do the tests and home, he just wants you to obey it and that sadistic humor that is sometimes great.The puzzles are masterful, of the best I've found in video games, which complement each other with a perfect level design that will have you trapped in Aperture Science.The setting is crazy, with perfect sounds for the environment and a very minimalist but very functional artistic style.It is essential.I just ask you to play it.",10,PC
"A brilliant idea with the portal gun, the gradual introduction of new elements to the puzzles, a wonderfully built plot and atmosphere. My only complaint is that the game is too short!",9,PC
One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Each level was hard enough to make me consider how to get past it but also not to hard to make the actual solution be nonsense. I just wish Portal was longer.,8,PC
Perfect for speedrunning. Really good. In my opinion it has one of the best tutorial. Best thing are the turrets. THEY ARE SO CUTE! The Humor is not for everyone but I love it. 10/10,10,PC
"Portal's innovative gameplay, clever puzzles, and dark humor combine to make it a standout title in the puzzle-platformer genre.",10,PC
The biggest blank for the buck,9,PC
"Portal is a great puzzles game that today continues to feel original and innovative.What stands out in this game are undoubtedly its careful and characteristic gameplay and its surprising physical, being the latter of the best I've seen in a video game.Each level offers new things and all the mechanics offered by the GUN portal are very well developed and integrated.As for the graphics, the game has not aged badly and that aesthetic it has contributes to a story full of irony but with an underlying terror that has managed to convey a unique sensation.This story is very brief and without complexity, but with few concepts it manages to be creepy.This helps one of the best characters I have seen in video games, GLADOS, since with his humor and his dialogues he makes the player feel uncomfortable constantly knowing that he is being used as a subject of tests.It should be noted that at the sound level it is not bad, and the soundtrack is based on a simple melody that sounds on certain occasions but that at the end of the game results in an unforgettable and masterful song.It is true that the final fight is somewhat disappointing, or that perhaps not all puzzles are extremely entertaining;But as a whole it gives a really solid work highly recommended for all types of player and lovers of Puzzles Games.8.8/10 (01/2022)",9,PC
"Strange story, complex and difficult puzzles in the whole good game that depends on you how much time you spend on it",9,PC
The puzzles are very nice and the game happens in addition to that to put a good atmosphere.,8,PC
"One of the best puzzle games out there with one of the most charismatic ""villain"" in gaming that will make you love her rather than hate her,",9,PC
"A classic among Puzzle Games, to do absolutely.Not always obvious rooms which often require observation and reflection to overcome it, without being too complex and boring.A renewal between the fairly impressive rooms which makes us keep us until the end, without adding too much mechanics to lose us.Infant it is a fairly simple game in the idea but which succeeds perfectly to balance everything for my taste, feasible by everyone, interesting for everyone.",10,PC
A good and sticking puzzle for a couple of hours.,8,PC
........................................................................yes,8,PC
One of the best in the world Source graphics are very good for gameplay and different than any other puzzle game I've never seen in my life this portal mechanics are in this game and puzzles are quite difficult and history and more or less,10,PC
"There are simply evil and great evil, and behind them both in the shadows are hidden very large evil.A very big evil, Geralt, is one that you cannot imagine, even if you think that nothing is able to surprise you.And you know, Geralt, sometimes it happens that a very great evil will grab you by the throat and say: “Choose, brother, or I, or that which is a little smaller”",8,PC
"Very interesting mechanism even after 15 years. Simple concept but you need to manage the concept to resolve the puzzles. The game design is also very smooth, you don't feel overwhelmed since the puzzles will guide you. The last mission is difficult but a very good example to show you how capable the game is. Didn't get a chance to play the additional missions.",9,PC

"Have I really to rate this game ? (I will do it) This game is really good, in this review, I will not talk about the good points but about the bad points. 1) The game is to short (I know it was a bonus game in the orange box). 2) The less steps challenge. 3) THE CAMERA SHY SUCCES",9,PC
"This game combines sarcastic humor that is hilarious, with fun puzzle solving. Plus it has a good end. ;)",9,PC
"portal is a single-player puzzle game, that has a lot of pros and almost zero cons, so let me list off the pros and cons pros: + the game makes your little monkey brain actually think on how to solve the levels and makes you smarter + most of the achievements are challenging, and fun to do + after you complete the game you can play bonus levels + the game has some comedy cons: - there is an achievement that is super hard to get unless you cheat your way out of doing it that's about it for the pros and cons, however i'm not done yet i'm flabbergasted that some people hate this game, because the game teaches you the basics and then leaves you alone and you have to slowly figure it out for yourself how to optimally figure out some puzzles and if you are stuck on a level for a long time, finally figuring out the solution fills your brain with dopamine. that's about it from me, the game is good and is a must-buy.",10,PC
"I love this game so much. Like it left a huge mark on me being the first pc game I have ever purchased, and it was worthy of a purchase. The atmosphere makes me feel like I am just alone, with my only guidance being an AI. The soundtrack replicates this so well, with tracks like “taste of blood,” “self esteem fund,” and “android hell.” The gameplay is also very good as well, since it revolves around solving puzzles with a gun that shoots portals (get cuz the game is named portal, you have a portal gun, what a revelation) and the icing of the cake (or a lie for that matter) is the story. It isn’t relatively a big cinematic story that has lots of characters and emotional moments, it’s just you, stuck in a chamber, alone, while an AI watches you solve puzzles. Overall, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10",10,PC
This gaming classic brought us this super good portal feature. Very original and fun puzzle game. I never actually paid attention but also storytelling method is also still valid in 2023 for me. No real downside for the game but only I'd like to mention that I am fun of tense atmosphere.,8,PC
A valaha volt Legjobb gondolkodós játék a Valve nagyon jól dönröt a Narbacular Drop felvásárlásával igen rövid de a Portal maga 1 órája annyi dolgot mond hogy csak na GLaDOS is nagyon jó magyarul meg pláne,10,PC
"This game has not yet played or completed, so I will put a different review and note when I do.",9,PC
"LUCKILY… STILL ALIVE BEFORE WE BEGIN: The game was tested in the Still Alive version, 100% completed and the platinum trophy has been obtained. A WILD PORTAL APPEARS!: Portal, as a typical Valve title, features impeccable level design and attention to detail right from the start. From the first minutes of play, everything is structured to create an exponential learning curve; initially the player will find himself inside a closed cell as Chell, a young girl who has been hired to test some new Aperture Science technology. Apparently, the capsule in which Chell lingers would appear to have no way out, but after a few seconds, thanks to the appearance of a portal, the player will be free to begin testing the various chambers of the Aperture facility. From there on, the player will be faced with several tests, and when he or she has mastered the potential of the blue portal, he or she will also unlock the orange one, kicking off the full potential of the game. A NEW CUBY FRIEND: As can be inferred from the name of the game or the introduction of the reviews, it is all about using portals, mainly two, one blue and one orange. These portals do not have different characteristics, but are actually unlocked at different times so that the player can figure out how to use one at a time. Several other mechanics are present, which in the same way as the portals are explained right from the start, namely the use of cubes to press buttons; obviously it is very intuitive as a mechanic, but combined with the use of portals to reach tricky buttons makes it more fun and complicated. Other mechanics rely on dodging and destroying deadly turrets, or repelling energy orbs in order to activate passages. Plot-wise, the first chapter does not hold a candle to the second, with a rather simple story with few narrative twists. HEY, THAT’S ME!: Graphically Portal awakens perfectly to a game of its era; moreover, due to its simplicity the game becomes almost immortal. Obviously, the aesthetics of the logos and the use of colors are excellently done. HEARING THE RADIO: From an audio standpoint, there is not much to discuss; the use of sound effects to make clear the use of the various game objects and their interaction with the environment is excellent. ACHIEVEMENTS: The achievements in this title are fairly simple and quick to complete. The Still Alive version of Portal provides several extra levels to tackle and two challenges in the campaign that are rather tough, namely finishing the game without ever being hit by turrets and finishing it by going only through orange portals. The latter is an obvious nod to the Orange Box collection and provides a more thoughtful approach to the game's puzzles. BUT WHY 9? PROS - CONS: All in all, the original Portal does not have much to discuss; all the pros have already been mentioned in the parts above; of negative points, however, I personally struggle to find any, as it really is a near-perfect game. Small appreciable detail in both Portal is the Commentary mode, where the developers explain their approach in the making of this title, useful for young programmers or very curious gamers.

"This game is like a prototype. The puzzles are short. It's not very confusing. As if Valve thought the game would not work, they made the game short and gave it together with the first orange box package.",8,PC
portals are cool. Glados is funny. i like this game more than portal 2 (though i still love that too) the writing is great. i love it. it is in my top 5 favorite games of all time,10,PC
"Bu This game can be played by those who like strategy, puzzle a little, and action. But let me tell you from the beginning. The puzzles in the game are mind-blowing. Even I barely finished the game. So don't be upset or angry if you can't pass any level when you play. The puzzles in the game are already very difficult :xd",10,PC
"It feels like a horror game with the music being so quiet and the voice acting being so cold you can almost feel as a kind of cold hate coming from it. the portals are so fun to play It's amazing that they even make this game 2007. It's truly is the highlight of the Orange Box. In the later half of the game they make you use your brain a lot more when you can't use the normal porto sit-ups and it feels like a jungle of metal you are pushing through. The song in the games credit is the most adorable I had heard. Please play this game. It's one of the best you can use 2 Hours on and you will be satisfied. Only sad thing is there is only 2 hours of it, but there's a sequel that is not as good but can satisfy you if you need more of the game puzzles.",10,PC

"An excellent, physics bending adventure through the quirky and oppressive test chambers of Aperture Science. The various test chamber puzzles are all enjoyable. Even the earliest, more tutorial oriented, test chambers find ways to keep the player engaged with the puzzle solving and the later game puzzles are difficult but fair, yielding a solid sense of achievement when they are overcome. GLaDOS is also a brilliantly written character that keeps you enthralled with every sentence. Portal is easily one of the greatest games of all time.",10,PC

Let's try from the first moments to look at everything around us, draw some conclusions and understand who we are in this World, and what surrounds us here? But what if we get a Portal gun? We will then be able to open Portals and move anywhere, and it doesn't matter if we can walk or talk, or do something else, because we will have some kind of weapon in our hands as joyfully limitless possibilities!",10,PC
"I went through the game in a couple of hours.A fucked plot, fucked gameplay, good soundtrack.The game is not outdated.Masterpiece.I join a detachment of people awaiting 3rd part.",10,PC
"I give Portal a lot of praise because it manages to take a genre I don’t normally like, puzzle games, and make it highly enjoyable for me. Part of that is it’s humour, which is fantastic, but it also take’s what is a very basic concept and makes it complex without being annoying. At it’s core you make up to two portals, but it’s up to you to figure out where to put them and how to use them to get to the end of a room. What I loved most was that for most of Portal it was very logical, it didn’t feel cheap or trying to be overly difficult for no reason. While a few times I felt stumped for a bit I always was able to figure things out because the game wasn’t being cheap in any way. The voice acting for Glados was some of the best I have seen and really made what would have been a great game into a classic. The end credits still make me smile to this day. The graphics were decent for it’s time, neither mind blowing or an eye sore. They have a very clean look to them for much of the time until near the end where you get into the bowels of the facility. The clean looking rooms were nice although the more dingy parts later showed the age of the engine more. The game does a great job of dropping hints about the lore as well as tying it into the Valve universe with Half-Life. I played Portal on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any bugs. There are nine graphics settings; four AA settings; six AF settings; a v-sync toggle and an FOV slider that goes from 75-110. Alt-tab didn’t work. You can manually save whenever you want. Performance was fantastic which wasn’t shocking given the age of the game. Game Engine: Source Graphics API: OpenGL Disk Space Used: 3.88 GB Graphics Settings Used: 8xAA; 16x AF; 100 FOV; v-sync on; all settings at highest except blur off GPU Usage: 17-60 % VRAM Usage: 1009-1448 MB CPU Usage: 3-11 % RAM Usage: 3.1-4.2 GB Frame Rate: 132-144 FPS Portal is a game that many will enjoy and still holds up today. It was a lot of fun and combines great game play with voice acting and presentation. It also does a great job of not overdoing it and not overstaying it’s welcome. Anyone should at least try the demo to Portal. I finished it in two hours and thirty one minutes. I paid $49.99 CAD for it as part of the Orange Box years ago and it is easily worth it’s current price tag of $11.49 CAD.

"The 2nd best puzzle game ever made, only second to it's sequel. The character writing and world building that takes place is just spectacular especially for such a short game.",9,PC
"A good video game, it's not a masterpiece either, but... it accomplishes its goal of entertaining and offering an interesting story; in the playable aspect it is very good despite the fact that the whole game consists of solving puzzles and/or tests to advance, this is due to its short duration of 1 hour approx., which helps the game not to become repetitive and boring . The story of the game is interesting, in this we are introduced to Chell, a test subject who wakes up in the Aperture Science facilities; an underground research laboratory. Where a robotic voice speaks to him and tells him that he will have to pass all the test chambers that will be placed on him. Later she tells us that by passing all the tests she will be rewarded with a cake and that we can also go with a team of psychologists, but, as she progresses, she will realize that all this was a farce. And she will be forced to escape from there no matter what, so that in the end, Chell in her attempt to escape ends up encountering the machine that was talking to her all the time, named GLaDOS, and finally Chell ""destroys"" her and "" escape"" from Aperture Science"". In conclusion, Portal is a video game that has more virtues than flaws, and it ends up being an entertaining video game, with a somewhat confusing story that leaves us with more questions than answers, but in the end it is still a good video game and nothing more.",8,PC
"[IT] Ottimo gioco, anche se leggermente corto a mio parere. Il nemico è molto carismatico e diventato iconico e i livelli non sono così semplici. Un ottimo titolo ancora oggi, invecchiato molto bene a quasi 15 anni dalla sua uscita. Da giocare assolutamente",9,PC
The most unique and creative game I have ever played. Glados is one of the greatest villains in gaming history I think.,10,PC
"Impressive puzzles and history, a game that should be played no matter the time",10,PC
"I bought the orange box with this game because it was a good deal. Very good choice. The portal mechanic is unique and very fun to play with. The puzzles are challenging and fun. The robot character and ending are great. I liked the ending song a lot as well. Everything about this game makes it a classic from being able to see yourself through portals to the mechanic of momentum carrying through portals. Must buy especially with the orange box deal. One small issue though, the game is short. It took me only 5 hours to complete it (although it is still worth the price).",10,PC
"One of the most perfect games ever! I don't want to spoil what I loved about it the most, but I can give away that they absolutely nailed the humor!",10,PC
"Grafonium, of course, is not as difficult as you are 10 years old, but still a good game, with the inherent universe to which it belongs to a gloomy technogenic atmosphere, a magnificent antagonist, witty humor and continuing to live with the playlists of the same song.And for 2007, when the release of the game for everyone was a surprise and no one knew anything about her at all, the game is completely great.",8,PC
This game is awesome. Not only because of the clever puzzles using the portal gun but also because of the atmosphere that the abandoned megastructure of Aperture Science creates. I really recommend it to both the players who like challenging puzzles and players who seek atmosphere and lore.,10,PC
"Legend, Best Game Ever.",10,PC
This game is great. I was suprised at how good it was for such a short game.,9,PC
+ Amazing puzzle design + Accessible for people who don't play puzzle games or FPP games + Fantastic writing + Timeless visuals The still unmatched king of puzzle games.,10,PC
A little game called Portal changed everything. It was part of the Orange Box and I could never imagine how good it was.,9,PC
"The atmosphere is unparalleled to any other game I can think of. Portal is best enjoined with no prior knowledge of the game and played alone with no distractions. Each puzzle strikes the right balance between challenging and never getting stuck, and the core gimmick is genius. I highly recommend everyone to play it.",9,PC
"Lacks the magic of Portal 2, but it's still really cool. Play them both, but this is very much in ""tech demo"" territory.",8,PC
"Portal's unique physics are complex enough to make the puzzles challenging, yet so imaginative that you never feel like you're stuck. The dark atmosphere and funny dialogue also becomes its own puzzle, as you try to figure out the true nature of the setting.",10,PC
"This is a great game! In this game, it's fun to fly among the portals and in this game there are a lot of puzzles, it even makes you think a little how to get through this room. This game, especially in our time, looks good in principle, and I recommend that you go through the first part first, because the second part is much better than the first and it is longer. The only drawback of the game is that it is played very quickly, in about 2-4 hours, and if you go on SPEEDRAN, then in general in 5 minutes. Eh. and Valve were making great games at that time, it's a pity that they rolled off. I recommend everyone to go through, you will not regret it!",8,PC
"The game came very much, it goes quickly (2 hours), not very complicated and the ending surprised.",10,PC
"Portal is a simple yet brilliant game. Would definitely recommend this game to anyone, especially considering how cheap you can find it on steam.",8,PC
"Portal is a first-person puzzle game made by valve and released in 2007. It combines the brilliance of the portal gun and the source engine to provide satisfying puzzles to solve. - Story The story of portal is fairly simple with a lot of undertones and lore for the player to interpret. You start off in a test chamber and are filled with the duty to run the experiment. As it turns out, While the base story is very simple it serves the purpose to motivate the player enough to get to the end. However, if you look into the lore it provides a much deeper context to the game. Small tidbit, the portal universe actually takes place in the same universe as half-life and there's a rivalry going on between aperture labs and black mesa. Another point towards the story is the subtle storytelling through the game art and walls. Kinda like Metroid and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the wild. - Gameplay The gameplay is where this game really shines through like a hidden gem. It makes use of the brilliantly made portal gun to solve puzzles on the next level. You can use it for various situations like using momentum to launch yourself higher or transport other objects like a companion cube. You really have to play it to know it but overall the gameplay serves its purpose well for this type of game. - Presentation I'm not much **** guy so i'll keep this segment short. The graphics in this game are well done. And by 2007 standards this game makes great use of the source engine. It's not Crysis but it does look good and runs really well. - Conclusion While I feel this game is slightly over-hyped it really does a great job immersing you into the world of portal and has really great level design akin to a Nintendo game. I would highly recommend picking it up especially on a sale.",8,PC
rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,9,PC
"A great implementation of mixing a 3D platformer, a puzzle game and a brilliant story. The atmosphere and the humor are also fitting. I can recommend this game (and its sequel) to literally everyone.",9,PC
Such a revolutionary game in your day that it still remains amazing these days!,10,PC
"One of the best puzzle games ever and the one to start all the ""lab with something messed up"" genre of puzzles. Timeless because of its simple and unique gameplay. Story is not impressive. Beautiful environments. Great sound design and dialogues.",8,PC
Creative though not challenging enough. Great game to start a classic series,8,PC
"After finishing the 3 -hour campaign (approx) of this game, I can say that I am somewhat short.Something that the game knew how to do very well, was to create an atmosphere of perfect loneliness.The design of the levels and the puzzles are very well worked and some became quite complicated.The graphics despite being ancient, are quite pleasant at view, although the aesthetics of the game is simplistic because it is a laboratory.The plot is nothing from the other world, I do not want to give spoilers but the plot is not the strong point of this game.The soundtrack is almost nil, in the few cases that music is present, it will be according to the psychological setting of the game (solitude), they are melancholic tones.Puzzles lovers recommend this game strongly",10,PC
"8/10 ️ - Very good (after completing the game several times) I did not expect such a fantastic atmosphere and humor from a logic-arcade game. Playing with portals is very rewarding. I fell in love with this story. It is a pity that the main character is silent and impersonal. The game is short, and you would like more after completing it",8,PC
"An excellent play of a puzzle with a view, so to speak from the eye)) an interesting idea .... interesting tasks ... An interesting main villain (merrified the whole game) I advise.",9,PC

Portal is a fantastic game. If you like puzzles and they do get a but tricky then its the game for you. It seems simple but has a darker story behind it and I love that in games. Theres also a surprising amount you can do after you beat it with the bonus maps and trying to get gold on all of them which would be the hardest part of the portal game experience.,9,PC
"amazing game. its great at every part of it, except plot, actually it might be much better i thing, but its pretty good anyway. and i cant mention my favourite test chamber in the whole game and probably ever its chamber 18, its perfect, i like it so much p.s. game is not that hard that i expected",9,PC

_Good game _,8,PC
"Summary: An achievement in humor and game design. The Good: + Every single joke lands on the spot because the voice acting is fantastic. + This is one of the only puzzle games which have a very polished difficulty curve: the puzzles never feel too easy or too hard in context of the game progression. The mechanics are simple, but the designers found many approaches to make clever puzzles out of them. The Bad: - Most of the game feels just like a tutorial.",10,PC
"This is a great game, very cool otmasfera! Interesting puzzles, and the plot I really liked the co-op is also cool definitely 10/10!",10,PC
"Great puzzle based on portals, and with memorable humor and plot.",9,PC
"Portal is a experience you can't get anywhere else, the game-play is simple and fun with puzzles that will test your mind to the limit. The portal gun is a really fun tool with loads of uses. I picked this game up when i got steam and the Portal bundle is a great deal with both Portal 1 and 2. I really enjoyed this game, please buy this game you won't regret it.",10,PC
Very interesting puzzle game with its unique features. It was extremely fun to exploit its main mechanics),9,PC
"The game has developed 2007 on the Source engine that you can not even go through the game in 3 hours, but you can not manage and for 8 hours of graphics, plot, humor (which is not in every game), the games are not badly made, do not forget that the cake is evil - evil",10,PC
"The writing was brilliant and the gameplay was so satisfying. Portal is one of the best video games ever made that improves upon anything that previous titles in the genre offered. Portal has a unique charm that you can't find it in any other game, Valve put love and passion behind this project. The director has done a wonderful job with the art style and the story was one of the best stories i ever played in video games. The game's short length cannot downgrade Portal's undeniably high value. Portal is a experience that you have to play.",10,PC
"Portal presented Valve at their best. Making innovative games that pushed the industry forward. Portal was a short game indeed, but its impact is still going on. Nowadays many of us want to experience a new portal title and that says something. Portal wasn't perfect, it was flawed indeed but at the same time it was an unseen masterpiece that pushed the industry forward, and showed many people games are high-art.",10,PC
"Yes, i know Portal was short and it lacked a more complete story but... This game was such an artistic masterpiece. Portal's Meta narrative certainly helped the industry to move toward more complicated stories and the gameplay (back in 2007) was something so new and innovative that revolutionized how developers designed a video game.",10,PC
Best puzzle game I've played. The robot woman is funny and portal gun is awesome! And NO! I don't care if the game is really short I still liked it!,9,PC
"Great game with great concept, it's a really short game yet has a low replay value (?)",9,PC
"Don't be deterred by the age, it looks like it could have been made yesterday. Coming in at a short 3 hours, it is definitely worth clearing your afternoon, getting comfy, and enjoying the charm Portal offers. Worth a play? Definitely!",10,PC
"Portal, is a 3D and Puzzo platform game, east, innovates with the new connection mechanics between portals.Well, first of all, this game is wonderful.Leaving aside the undoubted reference of GLADOS towards Hal of 2001, the humor of this game is better than many films and series that try to laugh, this is due to the subtlety with which it is implemented.The game lasts about two hours as you used to play games of this type.Anyway, it is an essential game for anyone.",10,PC
"Puzzles with portals of interesting things are sometimes difficult to also pleased Glados, how she is teasing the main character, the final battle so -so.",8,PC
Absolutely love the gameplay and graphics!,10,PC
Great game nice!!,9,PC
Masterpiece and a great beginning of Portal series. Strongly recommended to everyone.,10,PC
"The story mode is a bit short, but overall great.",8,PC
"The only bad thing about it is the length, on replays I can finish it in 30 minutes.",9,PC
"Likes: Great for new and experienced gamers The Feel/Aesthetic of the Game is on Point The Portal Gun is Fun and Creative The Puzzles and everything they bring up are Challenging and make you feel big brain The Robot Lady is funny but also somewhat unnerving and executes it perfectly The Little Robot Gunners Voice acting is very cute but are trying to kill you which makes a funny dynamic Dislikes: its a Short Game, Only About 2-3 Hours leaving more to be desired and theres not a lot of replay value after 1 Play of the campaign its a Funny, innovative, Creative, Accessible, Mind Engaging, Immersive Game that i recommend you play once in your life, especially since the price is cheap!",8,PC
"I love this game almost as much as I love the companion cube. Almost. I couldn't even kill it, I used glitches to keep it alive.",10,PC
"Gameplay: 10/10 Art & aesthetic in Story and Graphics: 7/10 Story: 8/10 Emotional Resonance: 7/10 Soundtrack: 10/10 Ending: 10/10 Urge to Play: 10/10 Fun: 10/10 Overall Rating: 90% Embarrassing to say this but yes, this was my first time playing Portal. Pretty late to the party lol. Yeah, I really loved it a lot. The gameplay is perfect, open for creativity for each individual run and stays timeless. I started to play games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. recently and realized that other games from that era don't hold nearly as much up as Portal. IT IS pretty much a perfect game. I wouldn't mind giving this a 10/10, but I feel like in it's simplicity, it ceases to be an ""INCREDIBLE"" experience. It is friggin' good, **** know, it does a lot with a little but I feel like a 10/10 is doing a lot with a lot, if you get what I'm saying. Great, short game. Can't wait to get on Portal 2.",9,PC
this game is good game. I like it. Boss fight I rate 10/10. Gameplay is 8.5 but this game did come out in 2009 so it is forgivable. If you are new puzzle games you should try portal.,9,PC
"A great game, it is a classic. This game is a must-play for everyone. It can not be explained in words how great this game is.",9,PC
Portal 1. Technical component - 10/10 2. Artificial intelligence - 10/10 3. Musical and video accompaniment - 9/10 4. Localization - 8/10 5. Setting - 10/10 6. The storyline is 9/10 Total = 56 points (9.3),9,PC
"This game is incredible innovative, fun and most of all, challenging. Great graphics for the time too",10,PC
"Portal deserves a solid 9/10. Maybe it is not as polished as Portal 2 in terms of maps and gameplay, but the fundament is absolutely outstanding.",9,PC
"Even though Portal is 3 hours long,the story is **** portal gun is one of the most revolutionary things in gaming history.Portal manages to be funny and creepy at the same time and Glados is one of the greatest and most well written characters in gaming **** steam sales Portal's price goes to 1,63 euros.Please do yourself a favor and buy **** will have a great time and you won't regret it.Plus it has a great replayability because it gives 20+ challenges and 6 advanced maps after you finish the campaign",10,PC
Fun easy puzzle game took me around 5 hours to complete the robot its funny the end of the game imo is the best part of the game.,8,PC
"RUS: I bought a game at a discount for about $ 1, the game has good puzzles, sometimes you need to act very quickly that it adds interest to the gameplay very much, a game with acceptable graphics of that time, but now it is not an extent.You will not get tired of the game since it is quite short compared to the next part.",8,PC
"Yes, I recommend this game because the game design is incredibly unique and innovative. Very few games have puzzles, physics, and mechanics that are as creative as this. However, if you are looking for a game that is consistently exciting and fun, Portal will not satisfy that desire. It can be slow-paced and confusing at times. Most people will play it once or twice, and then they'll quickly move on because the moment-to-moment gameplay doesn't really make them smile nor does it give them an adrenaline rush. That's why I would give Portal 8 out of 10 points. It is absolutely worth playing, but it doesn't have the ""fun factor"" to make me want to come back again and again.",8,PC
"Game is really good. Minimalistic surroundings of laboratory facility are background for nice, yet thought provoking, story full of humour. Portal definitely has aged well and still is great experience even in 2020.",9,PC
"This game is short but enjoyable. Good puzzles and a very good story, ( creepy and scary at some point). The principal tool is simple but gives a lot of game to the gameplay. Recommended and buy it in the steam sale for 2$",9,PC
"One of, if not the best game I've ever played. The puzzles are **** difficulty, but for me it's not the puzzles that made the game so great - it's the story and the atmosphere. The soundtrack, art style and writing combine to create a feeling of isolation, which is balanced by the humour to create what I believe goes beyond a game - I think that Portal was an experience.",10,PC
"Certainly a must-play for everybody! A clever, funny, and adventurous game.",9,PC
The best puzzle game ive ever played. The level design is fantastic and well thought. This game really stimulates your brain with the puzzles. The dialogue is charming. Glados is one of the most well-written robots ever. The graphics look typical for a Valve game but still kinda hold up. I highly reccomend this game. 10/10,10,PC
"Really well thought out game, although a bit short. When playing it, you're never bored, and the puzzles are never frustrating to complete.",10,PC
"Very unique idea for a game, that delivers some nice head scratchers. It's easy to see why this game is so popular.",10,PC
This is another universe for puzzle game. Second game is better then that one; but it is very delightful.,10,PC
"Some things in the game are not explained It is explained in Portal 2 If there was no Portal 2, it would be unfinished so 8 points.",8,PC
"I'm gonna **** my pants, what the hell was this, it got me so excited you wouldn't believe it. And there's a part 2? And it's even better? I'm becoming a valve fanboy and i didn't even expect it.",10,PC
"Great game, amazing mechanics, fun characters and really good puzzles. Only downside is that is too short. Still amazing game tho.",10,PC

"Portal is a logical game in The Orange Box.The only stud from the ""orange trio"" in which your brains will come in handy.Portal events unfold in the Aperture Science laboratory, the main competitor of the permissible Black Mesa.The main character is a girl with some strange appliances on her legs that do not allow her to break when falling from a great height.Throughout the game, the heroine is accompanied by a mechanical female voice of the Glados computer.Her comments are the top of wit and cynicism.Glados plays the main role in Portal, she is a star, she is magnificent!In addition to a computer aunt, talking turrets were very remembered, terribly screaming when they are dropped.What can you say - real women ... Sorry, but Single is more likely apertition than a full -fledged dish.Conducting preliminary tests, the developers noticed that some players hardly learn to use portals - the concept of holes in space simply does not fit in the head.Therefore, it was decided to carry out the fully program, and in the end, the process, of course, dragged on.But when the curve takes you to the very top, feel free to choose bonus cards in the main menu - there Valve disposed of the tasks more interesting: in the Challenges section, you need to go through the level using the minimum number of steps, portals or just as quickly as possible, Advanced puzzles of high complexity are collected.Portal does not reach the best game of the year, but the awards for the best concept are worthy.",9,PC
"Portal | November 2, 2020 | [★★★★] Just a quick recap of my innocence childhood, When I don't even know what GlaDos is mumbling about. Playing it again today with a perspective of Portal 2; Nothing from the sequel - ruins any value from this classic. Also, even though I know what's gonna happen from the beginning, I'm still mad that she lied.",9,PC
"Portal is one of the best narrative driven puzzle games ever created, the only thing is that it's too short",10,PC
Every single-player Valve game is a masterpiece on its own. The introduction to the Portal world is a fun-sized extraordinary game that I will cherish for ever.,9,PC
"Portal is a game that gives you a glimpse into a really intriguing world without giving you too much information or overstaying its welcome. It's a fantastic puzzle game with all the great world building that Valve is known for and it also has some of the best writing in any video game to date. I don't have a whole lot to say about Portal other than I've been a fan for over 10 years now and even though the game has gotten increasingly easier over the years, I still enjoy beating it every once in a while. Maybe its partially for nostalgia sake but I believe the game has decent replay value, given you don't remember how every puzzle is solved. My only complaint is that it's maybe a little too short but considering the price of the game, I'd say it's worth it. Also, like I said, the game probably would lose a lot of the charm if it overstayed its welcome. I haven't beaten Portal 2 in a very long time but one of the things I remember disliking is how long it was. The original doesn't have this problem. Portal has shaped meme culture, influenced countless puzzle games that followed it and helped maintain Valve's popularity during it's second era of game development. It's a near perfect little slice of puzzle game cake. *Keep in mind, the high rating is really only to show how good Portal is for what it is. This rating shouldn't be used to compare Portal to other games. Portal is near perfect for what it is but it wouldn't surpass a lot of the other games I've reviewed on this site when being directly compared with them. It's waaaaay too short to directly compare it to a full game experience. I beat this game in June of 2020 after beating it several times before.",9,PC
"One of the best puzzle-like games out there. My only complaint would be how short the game it, but that's basically it.",8,PC
"Simply a work of art, for those who are lover of puzzles (like me) will love this real game, great story and gameplay besides an amazing villain.Play, I guarantee you won't regret it.",9,PC

"Valve landed in 2007 with its Orange Box project, bringing together the expected Malf Life 2, Team Fortress 2 and the newcomer Portal.What can we say about this puzzle game that has become cult over time?The positive points: + an effective gameplay.A simple concept: the possibility of creating two portals.When you enter one, you come out of the other while keeping speed and objects.Simple to understand and ideal for developing sympathetic puzzles around this idea.+ A well-worked level-design.The puzzles keep going throughout the game, from the discovery of its mechanics until its conclusion which contrasts with the rest.+ Portal has become cult thanks to its atmosphere.Its kind of laboratory which, although super sanitized with its entirely white, silent and empty rooms, offers mechanics that are constantly renewed.And Glados, the only character with whom we interact throughout the game is perfectly written and doubled.The weak points: - although offering mechanics that often renew, Portal leaves a aftertaste of ""small"" experience once finished.Barely 3 hours to overcome the story of the game and ten hours to try all bonus puzzles, all in still very similar sets.Fortunately, the second opus will completely erase this defect.In conclusion, Portal is one of the most cult games of all time with its super nice atmosphere and its unique concept, which I warmly recommend to you despite its express lifespan.Do not hesitate to then tackle the second opus which really offers everything the first did, more successful.",8,PC

"I think no one expected this effect from this game.In my opinion, Portal overshadowed in The Orange Box, the main game of this release, Half-Life 2: Episode Two!I will explain why I think so.Everyone knew what to expect from Episode Two, with the exception of trifles, but Portal, was personally for me, a dark horse.I bought it, installed it and disappeared for the whole day.Yes, the game is short.But he is addictive, Ash to a headache, Christmas trees.I have not met anything like that before.And as it was supposed to, Portal became the ancestor of the whole direction of games, spatial puzzles, with the movement of his beloved, from the first person, according to various labyrinths.Her successors can be called such games as: The Talos Principle, The Witness, Q.U.B.E., The Toring Test and many others.The game has practically no plot, but she really does not need it.After a while, the sequel came out, with an intricate and difficult -pronounced name, Portal 2!And oddly enough, it turned out to be magnificent!The plot appeared, the puzzles improved and expanded, the passage time increased, and the graphics also burst out.Unfortunately, Valve faded and stopped making good, plot games, LEFT 4 DeAD 1 and 2 crafts, I can’t accept full -fledged games.Why strain?It was tolerated, it is better to “steam” om and “dota 2”, slightly moving the little finger of the left leg.Unfortunately, everything wins in our world of loot!Therefore, we are unlikely to see Portal 3 and the same Half-Life 3 in the near future, if we see at all.Although, oddly enough, Half-Life recently came out: Alyx, Game, I would say so, very far from everyone.For about 1% of games.But as great, Portal 3 looked now in VR!What do you think, huh?",9,PC

(sorry for my English :( )",10,PC
"Portal is an incredibly original game. Very funny, but also very intelligent. You don't have to like enigmas to like the game; starting the puzzle will immediatly raise your curiosity to the point you cannot leave the game before solving the puzzle.

"Cool, creepy, and intellectually challenging; Portal is one of the most top-notch puzzle games ever, while boasting a complex plot that, to me, hearkens back to ""2001: a Space Oddessy""!",10,PC
Amazing game! Puzzles are amazing! I advise this game to anyone who likes puzzles! 6hrs on record.,9,PC
"Portal and its sequel are the best puzzle games ever made. Portal has incredible level design, gameplay, aesthetics, story and voice attacking, and even though the game is short there is more to do once you finish.",10,PC
"Portal is as simple as you could possibly imagine and it’s so amazing. All the levels and puzzle solving is a masterpiece, with an atmosphere that keeps you hooked. With an evil robot Glados, she taunts you in every level and it’s great. It keeps the player in tacked. Sadly the game is short but it’s alright, it’s just another simple game with a few hours of gameplay and awesome puzzle solving, with awesome story telling. (Amaizng 4/5) Your Missing Out!",9,PC

"Portal is a short game in fact I’ve seen movies that are longer than portal, yet some games don’t accomplish what portal does in 100 hours. I love this game",10,PC
"This is probably the best game I have ever played and it will be forever. The type of puzzles are unique, you use a gun that shoots portals. You use these portals to fly, walk through, bring objects through and let things fly through. The story is told in a very great way. The atmosphere is nothing like you've seen before, Portal has the best atmosphere of any game I've played. The ending is great too, where you get to fight the voice behind the walls. This game isn't very repetitive. The last part is a tiny bit repetitive but for a short amount of time.",10,PC
"No replayability given and on top too easy. That's to put it short. The game feels like a demo, and there are only a handful of bosses, where the only difference in them is their move set. That's cheap FromSoftware. To overall call it a day, once you've learned the enemies patterns, the game gets boring and repetitive. So difficulty wise very easy like all games of such type I'm looking at you ""SIFU & Crash Bandicoot 4"". Yeah, that's about it, I don't recommend this game at all. The things mentioned above are pure facts and not debatable.",0,PC

There is no easy mode, simply because it would then become obvious, game has nothing to offer. Visuals are mediocre, camera movement is **** up, steering is awkward and feels like console. Music is awful and just annoying. User interface is from XX century. This game is not fun by any means. Absolutely don't understand such a high review notes. I get a seizure just at the sight of this game in my library.",0,PC
Don't waste your time. If you want to waste your time play elden ring. Sekiro is not worth 5 €,0,PC
"Kinda mid game. Artificial difficulty. You can't even grind mobs to upgrade your health bar. So what is a point. Point is in dodging and parrying lol. That is all there is to this game. Boring and repetitive. There is no opportunity in game, where u can upgrade your character to the point, when 5 identic mobs, which are useless alone can chain hit you and you die instantly. There is no rolling to dodge, parrying doesn't work, when you encounter many enemies at once. I don't know what exactly smoked creators of this game, but it was not good. It is a shame I spent money on this game. After Elden Ring and Bloodborne (masterpieces), I thought this game would also be good. Very disappointing.",4,PC
"The biggest issue I have with Sekiro is that it demands perfection from the player, yet punishes them for even the slightest misstep. The game's combat system is incredibly unforgiving, with enemies dealing massive damage with every hit and the player being forced to dodge and parry with split-second precision. This would be fine if the game's hit detection and controls were up to par, but unfortunately, they are not. Too often, I found myself dying because of bad hit detection or clunky controls. Sometimes, I would dodge an attack only to be hit anyway because the game didn't register my movement correctly. Other times, I would try to jump over an obstacle, only to get stuck on it and take damage from an enemy. These issues are frustrating enough on their own, but when combined with the game's punishing difficulty, they make for an experience that is more aggravating than enjoyable. Furthermore, while the game's story and world-building are certainly impressive, I found that they were often overshadowed by the game's difficulty. Instead of being able to fully immerse myself in the game's lore and characters, I was constantly stressed out about the next fight and whether or not I would be able to survive it. In conclusion, while I can see why some people might enjoy Sekiro's challenging gameplay, I personally find it to be a bad game due to its demanding nature and flawed mechanics. I hope that future games in the same vein will learn from Sekiro's mistakes and provide a more balanced and enjoyable experience for players.",3,PC
"Keep trying to like this but I find it really boring. Every fight I've engaged in is a parry fest, so many buttons I keep pressing the wrong ones and trying to find the right way to go amidst all the dingyness is a real pain. I think it's got some good idea's that were put together haphazardly. Tenchu on the PS One is better.",3,PC
"I'll give it a couple points for art design. Combat is terrible when coupled with obvious developer bugs (e.g. controller input lag and dropped/unregistered inputs. Curious how it only happens in From Software games and no others....). Sekiro dials up the From Software 'sunk cost' illogic of its fanbase to 12. 'Just keep at it until you git gud' except the combat is centered around these scripted death animations where the camera goes cinematic and then back to normal every few seconds when fighting a large number of enemies. How about instead, just let me fight all the enemies and kill them like a normal action game without the Alice in Wonderland syndrome? I gave it a few hours to see what the hype was all about. It should be a textbook lesson in poor game design that should be avoided at all costs with its counterpoint being Ninja Gaiden Black about what to strive for in a great action game.",2,PC
"No objective markers. You're on your own figuring out a complex maze. There are lots of times when you can get completely stuck with no idea of where to go next. But there would be a hidden pathway or a blind jump that you need to take. Story/characters are not explained. You just get to know one thing. That you need to save the prince. Who's killing whom and why. Why are loyal subjects turning traitors. No idea. An unsatisfying combat system. Sudden extreme difficulty spikes. Parry timing is way too small. You can't customize any weapons, armors. Stealth doesn't work (I upgraded to max)). Figure out the rhythm of the bosses by dying. Totally impossible (even for Sekiro character himself). Then rinse and repeat. Punishing death-penalty (no surprise since it was made by the same sadists from Dark Souls). Limited exploration. Invisible walls. Hidden (but compulsory) pathways. Overall rating - 0/10.",0,PC

"Obviously. Too. Difficult. Not because of the player, but because of mechanics such as physics, controls and absent blocking (compare it to God of War). No way of changing it. It's just made with some willing to make people break their controllers. Played it for 25 hours and got nothing except of corrupted nervous system, heart rate of 200 per minute dozens of times and seeing some beautiful sights, after which you start anew to hate this game and its creators as it is not for players, but the players' health is a sacrifice for it. And you shall pay for this! Lol, thanks, play this for yourself, perverted freaks who made it. You died. You died. You died. You died. You spent a couple of minutes just to get to the boss as you did every time... and died. Again. And again. And again. Why should someone play what does not want you to play it?

"Despite I've played all of souls-likes, I couldn't understand this game. Game is difficult in not a good meaning at all. Character progression is almost absent, a lot of skills, most of which are useless, no variety in weapons/builds or anything (just secondary helpers, but this is nothing), battle mechanics are totally about timing and repeating, except of scripted boss-fights, level of fun - below zero. As for me, this game doesn't deserve to be a part of phenomenal souls series. Still game levels are really beautiful, so 3 of 10.",3,PC
"This game undeservedly received the game of the year and such high marks from critics.And now I will try to convince you of this.Let's start with the pluses of ""Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice"", which I have not found much: 1. This is a visual style of play.This includes the design of the inventory, the terrain, the design of the characters, for someone it may like music.2. Voice acting characters.It's nice to hear the original voice acting for Japanese setting.On this, the advantages are over for me, and minuses begin.1. Combat system.The game deliberately makes us play through the block and parrying, but how is it serious about this if the enemy is 5 times more and his weapons the size of a house?It would be logical to dodge such enemies, but alas, this is not so.And of course, an endless strip of health, the game seems to hint that you should play as the developer wants and demolish a strip of endurance of the enemy.2. Substitutes ""Sekiro"".The protagonist feels like a slow piece of a pear for whipping.He puts the block and parry 1 seconds later than pressing the button, which in such games is simply unfair to the player.Fronts in the game are broken and it is better not to use them at all, the enemy is more likely to fall into you.3. Camera.The strongest boss in this game is your camera, which works even worse than in the Dark Souls series.Constant bastards for textures and for the enemy.And the most funny is that the most complex battles occur in narrow locations.4. The rope.I really don't understand how she works.In the same situations, you can be drawn, but you may not be pulled.Apparently this is known only to the master of Miyazaki himself.5. Interest.The game is absolutely not interesting to play and explore the world.If in ""Dark Souls"" we were looking for various weapons that have their own muvisets, searched for spells and equipment with their unique effects.Then we always find candies and useless objects used.Only occasionally we will stumble upon really interesting things, such as new techniques and new prostheses.6. Jumping.Jumping is made in the best traditions of fromSoftware, that is, through the back.The character will often jump where you do not want.Despite the fact that I think the game is bad, I advise you to play it and make sure of it yourself, or make sure for yourself the opposite.",3,PC
"The game for strong 1 out of 10 balls that pleased: a good setting, story, voice acting characters, good visual design that disappointed: the game does not work as conceived by the developers.I will explain with an example.Suppose you fight with the boss.A red hieroglyph lights up above him when he will make a strong attack.But not always, when you press the desired button, you block or reflect this attack.I think this is due to curve programmers who operate in Fromsoftware.Because to write such crooked tiets of attacks - we must try.Stelz mechanicus, who is like there is also disappointed, but in fact she is not.As well as too many monkeys (could diversify the animal world, and add tigers and bears) I really like the Darksoules series, but in my opinion, since the release of the 3rd part and the secto developer changed the entire composition of the programmers, otherwise I can’t explain why the game, which is conceived as good and interesting, is released with such poor quality and taims.",0,PC
"TLDR - Bloodborne, but they took out everything that made Bloodborne work, and set it in Japan, and also modelled it around the most finicky combat tactics from the Soulsborne series (namely parrying, which for some bizarre reason the fanboys try to argue is not actually a core, essential part of the gameplay loop despite being exactly that) FromSoft has continued their degeneration from tough-but-fair (Demon's Souls, mostly. Dark Souls 1, 95%) to Tough-and-****-the-player. The game plays nicely when it works, but unless you're a major masochist with hyperactive reflexes, I can't recommend it. Full text - Sekiro just doesn't do enough right to reach that same point of enjoyment. Your health is too low to start with, to the point where the first non-tutorial boss (Chained Ogre) can very easily knock off 50-75% of your health, roughly, meaning that if you take a single hit from your average enemy prior, he will kill you in one hit. Even if you live, you have a high chance of being flung off the map, which gets rid of the last of your health, making your respawn token's worthless. This is exacerbated when you reach Shinobi Hunter Eshin of Misen, who can take you from full health to dead faster than you can blink, you are given the opprotunity to pick up the Mikiri Counter combat skill, however it is damn near impossible to get it to work in the moment. This is both made worse by the fact that any attacks that result in a synced animation (grab attacks for instance) have some serious phantom range, to the point where you can dodge directly behind the Chained Ogre's lunging grab attack, and still get grabbed as the ogre yeets himself 180 degrees and grabs you anyway, the same thing can happen with Enshin. In no particular order I personally experienced multiple instances of being knocked out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not hit me and being grabbed out of the air by attacks that very clearly did not connect. I could go on about other things, about how the game can't tell if it's trying to be a fast paced action game or a stealth game, how the combat just doesn't match the game and it's difficulty in conjunction with your pitiful amounts of help, the game itself being generally misleading out or outright deceitful, like how it makes it clear early one that dodging is key, yet with most even basic enemies in the game, dodging is no guarentee that the enemy won't just spin in place like a top and hit you anyway. I could go on about how fighting more than one enemy at a time, which will happen very early on in the Hirata estate becausethe fact that enemies can see for miles is an absolute train wreck, or about how everything happens so quickly in a game that demands caution and precision making the game a miserable experience for those without the reflexes of a coked-up squirrel. In short, like Dark Souls 3, it suffers from Bloodborne syndrome, albeit to an outrageously higher degree. Fast paced combat that has no place in the game, lacking all the systems that made it work such as the Rally system. There IS an upgrade in the first technique scroll that allows to recover health on a deathblow, but that isn't going to help you because you generally don't get that many deathblows when it would be the most useful (i.e boss fights), and knowing the pitiful amount of health you get at the start, it probably would be uselss anyway. Hopefully by the time Elden Ring comes around, Miyazaki and co. will finally be over the hyper actively difficult game play that plagued Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 to a drastically lesser extent, and realize that it's just not fun having your skull caved in by relentless, artificial difficulty of homing attacks, low health at the start, and dying in 2-3 hits, and parry centered combat despite the fanboys screeching otherwise. If you're a horrendous Sadomasochist, I can see you getting mileage out of this. Otherwise, I really cannot bring myself to recommend this like I would FromSoft's previous work.",1,PC

"The game as a whole is really good for people not like me. I tried to love the game, really did, but I just couldn't. After about 10+ hours and several bosses, I decided I did not enjoy the combat or the controls, it felt very arcadey and like a game from another company. I did not expect the arcadiness of the game but also did not struggle much - and just to be clear, I don't get frustrated with From games. I beat all From games including BloodBorne and Demon Souls, and Sekiro to me was the weakest in terms of the feel and quality in game engine as a whole. I envy players who like this game a lot, maybe someday I will change my mind... As a massive From Software fan, I would advise for the new fans to be cautious going into Sekiro coming from Souls games, it is a very different game in terms of the movement and combat feel. There is a lot of zealotry going on and people will dislike/downvote into oblivion if you say the game can be unsatisfying for some people, especially for hardcore Souls game fans. I understand that people feel great satisfaction from beating this game, but to me it seems that a lot of people praises this game automatically just because it is a From Software game. Were it from any other company, the initial reviews would have been much harsher, and Sekiro fans will not accept that reality. That's why you don't see negative reviews for this game....",2,PC

Everything in the souls games stemmed from being lost in a strange and unfamiliar place.

No matter how much times you'll upgrade you attck power or abilities - your hits will barely scratch enemy's HP bar. Prosthetic are useless most of the times.

World: Beautiful world, lots of animals. Atmosphere: Its very watered down, feels like im on painkillers playing this game, like Im not connected to my environment. Not a nice feeling Compared to Far Cry 2, ohh, this game really **** hard. As a game itself it isnt any better because its really a shallow game that failed in my opinion right on release. Far Cry 2 was really atmospheric and had really good gunplay, this was a cashgrab on the name of Far Cry. Ubisoft :D",3,PC
"You are tasked to hunt an animal. You are required to use a bow. It takes you 2 seconds to fire a charged shot with minimal damage, and equal time to heal yourself for minimal health.

Thankfully I got this Game on Sale, sadly I wont be able to get a refund as it took me 3 years to even recover my uplay account.

"Terrible game and nothing to do with Uplay. I have no problem with Uplay whatsoever. What I don't like about this game is that its lame. FIrst of all the protagonist you play I did not get into at all. He's like an average everyday guy who supposedly has to rise up and learn how to survive under the guidance of a somewhat westernized native who finds him on the island after escaping some real life modern day pirates who kidnap him and his friends. It all sounds great on paper but the execution is so terrible and cliche that it made me cringe. First of all the main character is a dork.. completely unlikable. They went out of their way to apparently make him someone that the average gamer can supposedly relate to.. so I guess they made him ""nerdy"" or ""geeky"" or god knows what.. I don't know.. but the guy is annoying. And apparently it worked because 10's of thousands of reviews say how great the game is. Personally, I don't like it all and find it cliche, obnoxious, and off color. Secondly... the gameplay itself is agonizingly boring. You better have a monster of a computer because once the brilliance of the island environment wears off the gameplay itself is stupid and incredibly dull and boring. There are a *few* parts here and there that were well done (infiltrating a shipwreck was one)... for the most part wandering around the island and happening upon the same supposedly realistic modern day pirates driving around in a jeep or ""hunting"" wild animals was just plain ridiculous. I honestly don't know how so many people have given this game such a great review... but I assume its because they can relate to protagonist being a dork who supposedly rises up and learns how to survive. Personally I found it obnoxious, trite, and annoying. Over the years I go back to this game every so often to try to get into it and it is just so painfully boring in their sad attempts to make it so ""realistic"" the game pales in comparison to FC1. FC2 I also tried to get into and also found that game terrible after many attempts to get past the first hour of gameplay.",3,PC

"Far Cry 3 is an open world, action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed mainly by Ubisoft Montreal in conjunction with Ubisoft Massive, Ubisoft Red Storm, Ubisoft Shanghai, and Ubisoft Reflections, published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation **** Cry 3 is set on a tropical island between the Indian and Pacific Oceans. After a vacation goes awry, protagonist Jason Brody must save his friends, who have been kidnapped by pirates and escape from the island and its unhinged inhabitants.Jason Brody, his older and younger brothers Grant and Riley, his girlfriend Liza, and their friends Daisy, Keith, and Oliver, vacation in Bangkok to celebrate Riley getting his pilot's license. While skydiving, they land on an archipelago named the Rook Islands, controlled by pirates under the control of Vaas. Grant and Jason are held and taunted by Vaas while the others are taken to be held for ransom. Grant engineers their escape but is killed by Vaas; distraught, Jason manages to scramble away. He is met by Dennis Rogers, an inhabitant of the island working with the Rakyat tribe to seize control back from the pirates. Dennis sees the potential in Jason to follow the Rakyat ""path of the warrior"" in rescuing his friends, and gives him a tatau that gives Jason the strength and knowledge to defeat the pirates.",3,PC
"I had high hopes for this game, I didn't like the 2nd one, but the first one was something new and lots of fun. This one on the other hand started ok, but then it turned out to be repetitive, and I got bored tbh, even if I tried and tried to keep going. Graphics are great, hate the vanishing stuff and I had some performance issues. Can't say it's a bad game as I didn't beat it, but definitely not my type of games, and I love open world FPS.",4,PC
"This game is utterly ruined by the lack **** quick save. I can't keep track of how many times I died during the heat **** fight, only to have to reset from a spawn location, having to search out the fight and start all over again from scratch. Ruined the experience for me 100 percent. Where are the days where video game designers actually made games with the players in mind? If I want to quick save my game (like I could in the excellent Far Cry 2), then why can't I? It should be my choice. Why am I paying for an open world game, with my hard earned money, if it won't even give the essential features I want? On top of that, you are forced to install UPlay (Ubi's own form of DRM) to play this. If you purchased this through steam (like a lot of people have) having to install another layer of DRM is a huge pain in the ass. Way to stick it to the customers even more. The graphics are great, the story is actually really interesting. It's a bold game, and for that, I'm giving it a 3. However, the game is unplayable for me, so I can't give it a higher score. A 3 is a solid F, and that's what it deserves. Far Cry 1 and Far Cry 2 are still great games, and I recommend those. (I got 1, 2, 3, and Blood Dragon for 40 on steam, so not a huge loss for me). Stay away from 3 though. Obviously not made with the player in mind",3,PC
"Far Cry 3 is definitely a weird game. It will mind **** you so much and than leave you in your insanity. Just like that, like nothing happened. So we should start from the beginning. You are rich spoiled child who was kidnapped by some insane ****ed up island king of inbred tribals. Suddenly you are torn out from your dream life of parties and boredom into cruel reality. But kidnappers are too dumb and you and your older brother manage to escape. After short period of time your brother lays dead and you run through unknown jungle. You slip, you fall and you lose senses. When you wake up the real game begins. Now you can explore whole island on your own no matter what. You can liberate small forts on the island which will make roads safer (so they say). After liberation of some fort a car full of Rakyat, the tribals, will appear and take over the place, quoting stupid things 'till the end of time. Another thing of importance to the tribals are radio towers. If you can climb them up and destroy technical device of island king Vaas(and Vaas doesn't give a **** whole game), you will reveal a part of map and also make Vaas blind in this area. The side quests and collectibles will now show on the map too. But when you liberate whole island and explore whole map nothing happens. Not a single thank you. Tribals just don't care. And there is much more of what they don't care about. So you go and start side quests. And now some weird **** will happen. You can come across a guy who needs photos of dead pirates for his personal sick business. You will find a guy who's daughter was kidnapped by aliens and he needs to locate all of his packages. But when you do quest just ends and he doesn't give a **** about his daughter anymore. You will search for husband of one tribal woman, who thinks her husband is cheating on her, just to find him with another man. And so it goes like this, until you realize that all of Rakyat are pretty ****ed up bunch of liars and you just want to put them all down. So you will turn on to the last things you can do in this game: hunting for animals and relics. But sooner or later you will start to feel guilty for genocide of rare species, because bigger bags you make, more animals it takes. Until one point, when you need a rare animal and than you need to find a specific quest and hunt it with special weapon. So after lots of carnage you have all the bags and animals have no meaning in game anymore, except small enemies. Relics are scattered all over the island. You can find statuettes, memory cards and letters of japan soldiers from WWII. The informations on discs and letters are boring and just flat, and relics and letter spawn randomly on the island. So sooner or later you will return to the place where you took one relic, just to find another few meters further. So after a while it's boring and pointless too as all other activities. And after all these things you will return to the main story, where **** hits the fan. You will rescue all of your friends and slowly develop your ""warrior"" skills through some short missions of simple story. You will rescue you stupid stoned friend, who would certainly die but doesn't give a **** about gratitude after you save him. Your mean **** girlfriend, your older brothers girlfriend and at last your younger brother. And as this happy bunch you want to leave island. In this saving process you will inhale and eat so much drugs it would kill an ox but you will just walk away with a headache just to please everybody on this godforsaken island. You will please a tribal queen Citra just to disappoint her at the very end and also kill some god and island king and Rudolf's gay uncle and most evil boss German and ... and after all this ... you will be still mean **** and spoiled kid and yell yuck when you skin an animal and with big meaningless tattoo after all this ... you will stay on the island! There is no way home. No return. You will just stay there, kill bandit bosses with the knife like real Rakyat even if you rejected them at the end. You will encounter same two men patrols of pirates and mercenaries and the tribals won't still give a **** about you and drive like crazy killing their own on the roads and smashing the cars into trees. And than you will realize that this is a nightmare ... and it won't end until you uninstall the game... And still, it's not all I hated about this game, but I don't want to think about it anymore.",3,PC
"I can only recommend this game at Steam's 75% off price. FC3 has much the same problems FC2 had. Gameplay may have improved slightly, but its just as dumbed down, arcade and formulaic as last time. The world is still not persistent (which is important in an open world game that has some RPG elements). Corpses and loot vanish within seconds and vehicles just spawn or disappear right next to you, and so on. The usual checkpoint save system does not help here either - it does not save often enough and resets everything. The story is more engaging, but felt too unbelievable and often didn't make sense. I also didn't like the OTT drugs-debauchery-insanity-glorified-violence theme. The side-quests are mostly the FedEx variety, and among the worst I have ever seen. The game world has a bit of a theme park feel - everything is too close together (an enemy camp, friendly camp, and hunting range all in the space of a football field or two). Much of the landscape feels man-made, and no where near as impressive and natural as the island in Crysis 1. The enemy AI, which was one of the few really good things in FC2, seems to have been dumbed down in FC3, probably to make the stealth gameplay more accessible. Graphics, while ok, are clearly limited by the Xbox360 specs. Crysis 1 still looks better despite being 5 years older. Its not all bad though: the flip side to the flaws is that the game is very accessible to casual gamers. Also, the story's ancient temple exploration segments were just as good as the best parts in 2013's Tomb Raider. A pity there was not more of that. FC3 is also a good PC port, including adjustable FOV and mouse acceleration settings.",4,PC
It was entertaining enough to make you finish it. And it was good enough to re-play if you get bored. And it is great to test out a new GPU or CPU. However I did not think the any of the characters where likable. Vaas was the only interesting one. But most people would rather not play as a spoiled trust fund kid doing a poor job of playing tough guy. Also the graphics were not bad. But they were not as near as good as advertised. But the AAA on the PC version did clear it up a lot. Honestly it was not bad. But many things in the game could have been much better. You can tell it was pretty much Far Cry 2's engine with a texture upgrade and a new map and new story. And I will not be surprised to see Far Cry 4 with the same engine. But do not get me wrong It is not a bad engine. And there is nothing wrong with reusing a game engine as long as it stays with today's standards. But I think they could have done better with the texture upgrade. And surely the writers could have done better than a trust fund kid as the main character! So I give it a 4 out of 10. And I think a 4 out of 10 is more than fair for this game. The prices for games now is way too high and this game was no exception. This is another reason for my score. And the cost of the game should always reflect the review score if the reviewer is being honest.,4,PC

"I haven't played THAT much of this game yet, but so far I've found this game extremly underwhelming. Everything feels so generic. For example the hunting/harvesting (?), leaf a/b/c/d/e and animal hide a/b/c/d/e/f/g... Now can somebody tell my why everything have to be made of several different types of hide? Like to craft a backpack you need... I dunno, goat, a few strips of leopard, a patch of tiger... why not make everything out of one (or two) types of hide?! Or are we making a fashion statement, show the barbarians in the jungle how ""us citiboys"" do it? It feels like such a cheap way to add ""content"" to the game. A game like this is all about immersion, and I don't find it very immersive having to go into the menu for crafting etc. Absolutly nothing in the plot, conversations and in general how friendly people talk to you is believable. You are some **** cityboy who knows nothing about survival weapons or anything like that, yet you are the only one who can bla bla bla bla... yeah...",3,PC
"I really can't believe how bad this game is due to other reviews of it. Very tired of Ubisoft formula. SCORE 41/100. I thought it just had to be cool. I was let down in nearly every way imaginable. Still shocked how subpar, derivative, repetitive, and poorly designed it was. After beating and selling Watch Dogs (PS4), and then getting this on Summer Sale and really not liking it at all, I came to the conclusion I will no longer buy the trinity of Ubisoft open world action games. If you have played any Assassin's Creed or Watch Dogs, then you've played this. Towers to unlock, stupid collectibles, incredibly poor stealth, no actual cover. TOWERS ARE SO FAR APART, horrible when you die. This is a perfect example of huge open world that is empty, lifeless, and annoying. So, so annoying. Inventory is an atrocity, fills up in minutes, herbs don't stack. The driving is even worse than Watch Dogs, if that is possible. You get hurt from very small jumps, it's stupid. In some ways I am glad I got it on summer sale because I won't ever get another Ubisoft game at full price. I *might* get them for 10 bucks or buy and resell of the PS4, but never ever full price. And the graphics aren't that great, because Ubisoft is really bad at optimizing game engines. Tomb Raider and Hitman Absolution look much better. To top it all off, UPLAY IS A NIGHTMARE. It's a terrible service that makes EA's Origin look fantastic in comparison, and that is saying a lot.",4,PC
"For the most part, I enjoyed the running around and clearing camps aspect of the game. I was hoping for a little more in the crafting department, but I was ultimately satisfied with what the game provided. What drove me insane about this game were the boss puzzles. Very rarely were they actually combat. Instead, you had to memorize the key combinations or beat the clock. These gimmicks get old very quickly. The story and atmosphere of the game went a long way to diminish what could have been a very strong game. To put it bluntly, the game was one big cliche'. Every so called ""twist"" was so predictable as to be painful. I also find the concept of ""experienced combat veteran"" (Grant) getting killed in the first few minutes and ""incompetent noncombatant becoming god of war"" (Jason) one of the most annoying tropes ever. As mentioned in other reviews, Grant was the logical choice for being the hero. I don't like ""busy work"" in my games. Having to collect x number of y objects is a surefire recipe to boredom. Some of the backdrops (namely ruins and submerged caves) made the process a lot easier, but truthfully I never intended to finish those mini-games. This is a common weakness among Ubisoft games. Finally, I personally am not a subscriber to either tattoos or recreational drug use, both of which play a central role to the game; both in story and in gameplay. The whole glorification of substance abuse made the game so much less that what it could be. Now on to some good stuff. The Dunia engine is amazing. I love the seamless transition between wandering the jungle, swimming in the ocean, finding an underwater cave and then swimming into an ancient ruin. I had fun with the gunplay. I thought sniping a bit weak, especially with the .50 cal. A really powerful scope and you can easily hit something from 1k away. I realize why the sniping was clipped, but it was still a disappointment. I was glad to see that spreading fire carried over from Far Cry 2. I was very grateful for the absence of many of Far Cry 2's mechanics. Weapons don't degrade that fast. Even the cheapest of weapons would last longer. Malaria was stupid. The perpetually respawning enemy outposts was also thankfully absent. I suppose it says something about a game when some of its positive aspects are omissions from its prequel. The single most disappointing thing is that I saw the potential for the 10 scores that people keep throwing out there. It could have been ""THE"" game of the year. Whether it was lackluster development or different design philosophy, that potential was wasted. Still wasn't as bad as Mass Effect 3.",2,PC

"This is possibly one of the worst written and acted games I have EVER played. The voice acting is so cringe worthy and atrocious that you will end up rooting for the bad guys to kill your character. The combat is much too easy with every human enemy dying in one or two rounds (or arrows) and animals being slightly harder. The graphics are the only thing worth giving a plus for, as the game drags on way too long with the dumbest story you will ever experience. A spoiled rich kid with a prepubescent voice killing off pirates that the local militia apparently aren't capable of. The weapons can all be obtained within a couple of hours as money is everywhere, and the Assassins Creed like radio towers provide them for free. On top of that, the game crashes every two hours without giving you a hint as to why. It makes me wonder if the professional critics played the same game as I did. I give it two points for the graphics, but that is honestly the only redeemable thing about it. The experience was just loathsome, especially the voice acting will make you want to stop playing as soon as anyone talks.",2,PC
"This game is full of **** I don;t know where to start. In short, the only thing great is the graphics. The map is huge, but tedious to travel around, especially at early stages of the game, when every few seconds a car full of enemies will pass by wherever you're at. If you decide to fight them, its an endless fight because they somehow keep spawning like rabbits. The animals are even tougher, as they are immune to headshots, which is a **** joke. The looting system is crap. The hitbox for detecting the bodies is incredibly small, I practically have to be kissing the body to loot it. And even if I am pointing my crosshair at the body, the indicator is to loot the gun instead. And whats with all the 'hold button x' to do this or do that? If they are so afraid of us misclicking stuff, I cant count the times I mis-looted a weapon instead of a body. The stealth is **** They cant see me crouching in the open, but can detect me even though I'm hiding behind a huge tree that completely blocks line of sight. Enemies can see through walls to detect dead bodies, instantly detects me when I make a sound by melee-ing the animal cage (was testing if i could melee to break the cage). Said cage was inside a vacant building. Another stupid feature is the drag corpse perk. Its already stupid enough that jason has to learn how to move a corpse, the whole mechanic is just clumsy and ****ty. If you have played any decent stealth game like Dishonored or AC, you will know what I mean. In these games, you can just pick up the body, move and drop it anywhere. Here? You can only drag it like a **** while moving backwards, and the best part is, you cant even pick it up again if u drop it. The story is laughable too. 19 year old party boy becomes a master of guerrilla warfare in less then 30 minutes. Side quests are boring and restrictive too. Stuff like restricting weapon required to kill with and the failing quests if moving out of area is just stupid and nowhere near Skyrim-like. To mention this **** game in the same breath as Skyrim is just insulting to the TES game.",3,PC

"Seriously? Far Cry 3? More like Far Cry 2.5 with newer graphics and higher system requirements. I was really looking forward to this game after reading the reviews. Ah the memories of the original Far Cry where it was new and original. I thought, hey, maybe they changed it up a bit. NOPE. Same old, same old. Driving, or fast traveling, from place to place. Radio towers to get to and sabotage. Repetitive missions. Hang gliding, zip lining. BORING. Same clunky weapons buying and upgrade system. Now need to craft bigger wallets, weapons belts, etc... So they mixed in Skyrim RPG elements of crafting into a FPS style game? And not only that, did it in a poor design? Running around killing animals located who knows where to make a new belt? Who thought up that horrible idea? I'd rather you have to find, or kill someone, to get that new weapon, or upgrade rather then swim around with sharks to make what I need. This game stinks. Pros: Great graphics. Got it for $29 on sale at Target. Thank god I didn't pay full price. If you haven't played 1 or 2, then you'll find it a good game. If you've played either, then there is nothing new to see here. Cons: Everything. Nothing fresh, nothing new. A game can't get by on looks alone. I don't mind game sequels, and some are great. However, this is just a dressed up, new version of what got boring and old in Far Cry 2. Conclusion: I wish I hadn't spent $29 on this dung heap. Maybe a Steam sale at $7 or something, and just playing it to see the graphics and experiment if you were going to like the game and I'd be Okay with it. However, it is simply a terrible rehash of what is now a series that either needs a complete reboot or simply to go away.",2,PC
Bought the game off steam after it had been out a while as I heard a few people weren't too happy with it. Only paid 20 bucks I think. After 30min of play I am pretty disappointed too due to the dumbing down effect the game forces you into. Even the loot and money are visible on your HUD. I doesn't really feel like you are in any danger at anytime when engaging in gangs as the AI is pretty stupid and even on hard settings just not challenging. The game becomes very repetitive very quick due to just capturing radio masts and moving to the next one. Probably worth $15 to $20 in terms of eye candy and content. But I wont be buying any more Far Cry franchises regardless of price. Bought Far Cry 2 too and this series is done.,4,PC

"This game is at best, average. The side missions are dumb. You have all these kinds of guns but you are limited to using a knife on missions. Each outpost you must liberate are basically the same. 4 enemies, kill them all then it's yours. It gets pretty repetitive. Not to mention that there is no point in exploration in this game. Once you are done in an area, there's no point in going back to it, because it will stay that way the entire game, it will not be re-conquered by bad guys or some other scenario, it's very static, not a dynamic world. It would have been more interesting if there's constant fighting between the rebels and the pirates, where you could jump in and be the difference maker, but there is no such thing in Farcry 3. It's a single play-through game that's not worth 60 bucks retail. I would not advise in getting the mods for this game as many of those things replace binaries, which could be a carrier for a trojan virus. Mods are done by strangers, not an official company.",4,PC
"I started out hopeful that the game would be as good as Far Cry 2 and was very quickly disappointed. I thought I set all video to the highest possible settings and the movement was so fluid as to be unplayable. I kept overshooting the mark on the opening chase and everything looks like flat decals with weird black halos that I guess are cheap imitations of shadows. I later found an additional video settings menu that allowed me to set everything to ultra and then set the sensitivity settings to zero, that slowed movement enough to make the game playable. The user interface is has a very steep learning curve, why are they trying to re-invent the wheel? I have to log into steam to start the game which only starts uplay, then I have to wait for it to update, then log into uplay and finally i can start the game which takes kinda long to load screens.

This becomes very annoying when you go to a mission where you have a time limit and have to run through buildings and when you cannot complete the mission (mostly because of the problems with the character getting stuck to stairs and such things) the game reloads back to the start of the mission with time limit and there is no way to abandon the mission.",4,PC
"Are critics paid to write so positively about this game and gave it an average 9? If I am to quantify the game with a number, it wouldn't be anything higher than a 4. The fact that they put a nervy, squeaky, cowardly spoiled middle-class little brat as the protagonist has already killed 50% of the mood of anyone who tried to play it. It was hard to identify yourself with the main character and immerse yourself into the game if the voice actor, perhaps as the game design intended, sounds like an immature 17 years old. The constant unpleasantness of the voice only becomes more unbearable as you continue to play with the slightest hope that this game has more to offer to overshadow its flaws. But then the clunky inflexible control which forced sprint command to a toggle as opposed to hold-to-sprint (can you believe that?), and the faster-than-should-be walk speed killed any last hope you might still have for the game. The UI design was so bland and uninspired, you might think the game designers had copied it from games from 1996. At some point you realized, if you tab-out and tab-in again, the mouse function would no longer work and you'd have to restart the game for it to work again. At that precise moment you further realized this game doesn't have a proper, game-friendly save system, and you're forced to work in missions for mission checkpoints, the only thing that saves your game. The overall game mechanic and graphic style are basically the same as that of far cry 2 or fallout new vegas. You thought you might be getting something big with FC3, seeing how games like Crysis 3 and Battlefield 3 had pushed graphic realism to a ridiculous level. But in FC3 all you get is disappointment through and through. To put things into perspective, Far Cry 3 is like casting Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs in an already uninspired, poorly scrambled screenplay. It's hard to quantify with a number but for a game as broken, unpolished, and mediocre as FC3, this game deserves 4. And to counterbalance the fact that the game is badly overrated and will continue to victimize consumers who may be be ill-informed about the game, I voted 0.",0,PC
"Maybe it is because I liked Far Cry 2 so much. No maps showing everything, you had to look and listen to survive. Far Cry 3 is the opposite maps show everything.

"I got the game on the steam summer sale. Was great for the first 3 hours that i played. Tried to save it several times and said i couldnt save it it said the ""auto""save would take care of it. Died once-and it was stuck on the saving screen-i guess it had to communicate with U plays stupid effin servers! its my fault. I forgot that you needed uplay to run it and i hate uplay i hate origin i hate that i cant just go out and buy a god damned game and put it in and install it like the old days. anyway, i played six hours, swore i SAVED it several times and guess what? it saved right after the guy dennis rescued me so I lost- -all the i crafted ie;bags, wallets etc -my rife that i spent 1700 bucks for -my compound bow which was awesome i lost it all and now i dont know if i want to go through it all again, it saved none of my progress, lost all the radio towers i took, all the strongholds or whatever.. **** drm ruins everything when the will they learn? never...they never will and I wish something would happen to these assanine companies but it never will..anyway, i gotta give it a **** i could save it and not have to go through the first part 3 times id do it ..but this uplay drm",1,PC
"After hearing so ma ny good things about this game, I it knowing that it didn't support Steam achievements and required UBI's horrendous Uplay DRM software. Sadly, the game didn't come close to living up to the hype. The weapons feel anemic, in that basic animals and any armored human target requires almost a full clip to dispatch with anything other than a sniper rifle or a head-shot. Seriously, it shouldn't take five shots from an mp14 to drop a wild dog, and it certainly shouldn't take two entire clips to kill a bear. The AI is awful you basically have to run into someone while crouched before combat starts, but if you miss a shot with a silenced sniper rifle from 1km, enemies will magically converge on your location as if you were glowing like the sun. The graphics are quite nice and I have played through it without a single crash, but the gameplay isn't generally compelling.",3,PC
"this is one of the greatest open world games!!! everything in the game is great exept the story and few glitches. the story just doesnt make sense. it isnt the worst i seen but its hard to believe it or get attached to the characters and your friends. the thing that saves the story is vaas. Vaas is one of the greatest villans of all time!!!!! vaas is insane and the voice acter is just amazing!!! the game has few glitches. for the size of the game they arent so bad but they still are present. now to the good things. the world is just huge. there is tones to do and a lot to explore. the game is full with gorgeous old temples and amazing cliffs and waterfalls. there are also a lot of underwater tunnels and wrecked ships to explore. there are a lot of collectibles. normally i dont like finding collectibles but here its really fun and cool. the game also has a lot of side missions which are really fun. the game has skill trees. they are overall pretty good and they give you useful and fun abilities. the game also has a lot of first person animations. from taking a bullet out of your hand, to climbing plants, the animations are great and really immerse you. the stealth in the game is great as well. you can play the missions how you want to, stealthily or guns blazing. the AI is good. the guns feel great and there are a lot of them. this is an awesome open world game!!!! BUY IT ITS AWESOME!!!!!",0,PC
This game has always dissapointed me from the second edition Here to make it simple : Firstly When i first played far cry2 all i can get is a boring experience Driving car like hell so weird looking at the super-boring environment I am not really into FPS games but at least i like to play call of duty why because i can get as many environment details so the game wont feel flat and also there is many conversations along the game that i wont bored . note to game developer players love freedom and soul in their game and this game is totally soul-less . secondly the graphic was badly optimized for PC i have lowered my pc graphics system but still it lags Even if i maximized the resolutions all i can get is so damn cartoonish grass and bushes thirdly why i still want to give 3 for the score because the game Borneo or somewhere near there takes place near my home indonesia,3,PC
"Far Cry 3 was really disappointment game even the story is good and it have Interesting characters but rest of the game is just meh and poorly made that made game way too easy even on master difficulty that i only played on half way then i stopped playign it. Every time i try play FC3 more, more i start hate it because of: Really bad enemy and team mate AI Useless crafting Useless rpg element that make game even more easier Useless hunting after you get all crafting itmes Build-in wall hack that they force you to use it Really bad mouse keyboard controlls especially aiming that is your worst enemy in whole game and force you to use controller Poor and useless fire element and it's also bugged that most of time you get hurt by invisible fire Way too many bugs from release day and they are still there Poorly optimized After dying you spawn random place and never to last save place And list go on and on and on.......

"The drm is annoying. IF i had bought this game in a store instead of steam, i would have returned it by now just because of the drm. The crafting element is too broken, if you have played any crafting game before, then you know how to get infinite health. The ai and stealth is broken. I was able to sneak up on someone for a knife take down in broad daylight with two other guys three meters from me. Everything else is great. But the drm kills it for me. It eats bandwith, and if you have a java update, or itunes update pop up in the background, the game may crash. Not sure if its the game or the drm causing it.",2,PC
"So apparently I am some who just saw his brother get killed. Instead of turning around an raging an trying to murder the bad guy, I have no choice but to run, cause it's scripted. Apparently I can fall an break an be just fine too. Then I wake up to some wierd lookin guy that tells me I am part of some destiny bull**** to help his people. I get some lame mission to climb a stupid tower an break the lock on the panel with the blunt end of the knife. I am not allowed to just drive around, it resets until I complete this stupid quest. This repeats like 3 times then finally I am allowed to just do whatever. So I find out the that killed my brother is on some island to the south. What the am I gonna do... go kill some boars an wtfpwn everything with my awesomesauce fps skills for the 5000th time to unlock some bull**** I dont need or just roll up in there an ****in get the job done. Of course I choose rambo option. So I head south, an wipe out any resistance along the way, I upgrade from a handgun to an AK-47 and I feel I am well prepared to beat the game. Then I notice it's an island and there is a decent amount of water between it and I. So naturally I go along the coast lookin for a boat. I see some bad guys patrolling in one. I know they are bad cause they wear red, all of them. They must be a corporation of pirates that have to wear uniforms or they get fired. So anyways I see these dumbasses tootin around in a boat so I shoot my gun at them to attract them. Naturally they can't see a guy on the beach shooting his gun, nor hear it. So I find a boat then chase em down and then finally they see me. So I stop, headshot both guys, then go to their boat. Oh snap their boat has a mounted 50 cal. Now I am really set to beat the game. So I head towards what I presume is the bad guys base so I can get my revenge. I don't give 2 ****s about saving all the rest of the idiots who got caught, it's not my fault they **** too much to not escape. So as I am driving I get a warning, out of bounds. I say that, maybe they will just do it GTA style an send like a navy of corporate pirates... I can handle that. Then it resets me back to the beach. End of game. ****ing quit this piece of trash. I don't need to jump through 500 hoops, skin dogs, cats, people or whatever, pick daisies and all this other bull**** just so I can get nifty moves or hold more than 2 clips for my rifle. every bad guy has bullets. I can just kill my way to the top. Apparently I am too advanced for this game though and the story is not ready for me to just surprise him an say hey you man... remember me? I think that would have been a great cutscene for people that don't want their hands held. Apparently even with the game on the hardest settting, there is no way to play hard mode. you far cry 3.

"This game had many many great things going for it, and friends as well as many of you here in the reviews recommended it and praised it. But sadly, as much as I tried to enjoy it, it really felt sub-par. I have a decently well made computer and even on low I had enough lag to make game play annoying, not a game to get if your computer cannot handle Skyrim even. I liked the story up until I decided I was done with it, and I thought the ta-tau was an interesting addition. I wish Ubisoft would have optimized their game better, when I opened the game for the first time I got a wave of lag and terrible graphics, I think I spent around an hour google-ing ways to fix graphical issues and screen tears, and tuning the sensitivity and such to an acceptable level. Now after all of this I had bought this game to play with a friend first and do the solo campaign, well, solo. That was not going to happen, friends couldn't connect to me, even the slightest, all 3 of my friends were completely unable to connect to my match, even after a lot of forum reading and such no results were produced. Now all of this is pretty bad but on top of that I had to deal with U-play and Steam both running on the same game, for the love of all that is sacred what was that!? I took a lot of time to sign up before I could play after paying 60$. As if that wasn't bad enough I get in game and immediately get spammed by tutorials so much so that I just felt overwhelmed. I really think this game could have been better with a little more effort on the side of the publishing and optimization of Far cry 3, but alas it was too tarnished by my experience for me to be able to look past it's flaws.",3,PC

"Just an other oversimplification of a console game. There was a time when Far Cry was about innovation, challenge, freedom. Innovation is still present, freedom is awesome too, but challenge ruins it all. Playing against an AI with an IQ below 50 is pretty boring even on the most difficult settings. Pirates starting to shoot at you from the middle of a field using no cover. I personally stopped playing after I was in a fight with 10 npc's, while there was a group of pirates 20 meters away that were just chilling or I dunno what, just standing there enjoying the sun. It's pretty obvious that the game is a cheap console port. If it wasn't made for console, the game wouldn't be that limited, not talking about the bugs.... If you are a young dumb teenager, you'll love it",0,PC
"A real step DOWN from Far Cry 2. The great thing about Far Cry 2 was you could decide which path to follow. In Far Cry 3 it's a mission-based linear stealth game. It pretends to be non-linear and open, but missions are forced on you, with no way of avoiding them, and you are forced to repeat them over and over till you GET IT RIGHT!!! Not only do you have to get the objective, you have to get there in the manner determined by the designers, not your own style. Try departing from the script and ten thousand baddies will descend on you and blast you to pieces. In the end you find you're in a linear stealth adventure. Oh, and the AI is terrible. Graphically it is no better than Far Cry 2.",2,PC
"I've played both far cry 1 and 2 and I can honestly say that the third installment to the series is probably the weakest. The first game was way ahead of it's time and I played that game for years. The second game was a mixed bag. It had some components to it that were a first for the genre like pulling bullets out of your body and having to fix your gun from being jammed to having to fix your broken down vehicle. The little things are what make or break a game imo, things like looking down and actually being able to see your feet or when you reach for something you see your hand extend and you pick it up or turn the handle. I can't stand it when things just teleport into my inventory or doors magically open. These are easy things to fix and they immerse you into the game. Unfortunately far cry 2's AI was some of the worst I have ever seen in a game. The graphics and fire were amazing, but only a couple of things kept the game from being one of the best FPS's of all time; bad AI and having to travel for miles and miles. I was hoping that Far Cry 3 would take the best things from both games and make a masterpiece. WRONG. The story isn't bad, but it's hard to really immerse yourself into the game, wanting to be like Rambo, when you are in control of a whimpy, whinny little teenage kid. The fact that right away the Island dwellers want you to save their homeland and you simply agree to it is ridiculous, not to mention they want you to do all the work! My most anticipated part of the whole game was the hunting aspect because when I played Crysis 1 I absolutely love hunting the enemy in the jungle. In Far Cry 3, the possibility of being attacked by a shark swimming to your boat or getting eaten by an alligator or tiger is pretty cool, but it wears off pretty quickly when you have to do it just to make bigger holsters for weapons and ammo all the time. Sorry but I don't want to go hunt some stupid goat or pig just to see some horribly inaccurate stab animation with a knife and pull out its organs. At least make the animation realistic. The menus, while not terrible, are far from the best I have used. Something really annoying is that I spent a good half hour trying to figure out how to make explosive tip arrows, finally just giving up and googling it to find out that they are just magically accessible once you get so far into the main story. It would have been nice to have that explained in the weapons info page. I got to hang glide, but that was surprisingly boring. Not much to see really and no point in doing it. There are like fifty different ways to get somewhere and hang gliding as slow as molasses is not my cup of tea. The graphics are a huge disappointment. When you zoom in with your camera, you can see pop in and textures that are all out of place. I maxed out the video settings, but why put my pc through that when I can play at lower settings and see pretty much zero difference? Glad they put in all those **** bad they don't do anything relevant aside from bogging down your system. Console port for sure. Btw, I would like to know where to buy one of those amazing cameras that can somehow track enemies and animals in real time. Pretty amazing. Amazingly dumb that is. If you want to just shoot guns you're in for a real treat because getting all of them is as easy as pie. Just climb all the radio towers and they become free in all the stores. Lame'o. About the fifth mission in, they tell you to explore the island, which I did, and by the time I started my next mission, I was so over powered that it was a cake walk clearing out enemy encampments. I mean seriously, what is the point of exploring an island when everything is already displayed on your map? I have no incentive to keep playing this game because everything is handed over on a silver platter. Btw, Uplay is extremely annoying. I was without internet for like two weeks and it became readily apparent that without internet this game is pretty much unplayable. Like steam, you have to log on in order to log off to play offline. We need a better solution people. All in all, this game is a huge disappointment. This games biggest flaw is that after about three hours of playtime, you really have no reason to continue, aside from the lame story that is. An open world sandbox game should be more fun than this. In a nutshell, this game is just plain boring.",3,PC
"I'd heard lots of good things about this game, and I've been a fan of the previous games (the original more than it's sequel). I'd heard that it didn't continue the plot or characters from either of the two previous games, which was a shame, but if the ongoing theme of the FarCry series was to have a standalone story with each episode, then I figured, why not? I'd read that the HUD was a bit too cluttered, but that there were various mods to minimise or even remove it, so I was encouraged by the fact that I would be able to customise certain aspects if I felt it was required. I'd also heard that the plot was weak, but that the game-play more than made up for it. So I was prepared for that too. What I wasn't prepared for was how much of an utter disappoint the game really was. In my opinion the HUD and terrible plot are MORE than enough to ruin the game, and it baffles me that anyone could even get past these two obstacles to even enjoy the game-play. Thankfully, I had installed a couple of mods to improve game-play (more accurate weapons and improved selection) and remove the HUD completely (the official patch didn't go anywhere near far enough in this regard), so the game I am scoring here is not the game I've been playing for the last three weeks, it's the game I would have been forced to play without the mods. Seriously, who needs that amount of information flashing and bobbing around on their screen to tell them the SAME thing at least three times? The HUD elements, even with all the customisable ones turned off, turn a potentially enjoyable challenge into a ridiculously easy arcade game, where neither thought, exploration or initiative are required. Objectives tell you to 'find' this or 'locate' that, and yet the whereabouts of every objective, no, every STAGE of every objective, is indicated in three different places, two of which are on your HUD (not including what you can actually see with your eyes!). The AI of the enemies is fantastic, amongst the best I've encountered, but the poor sods don't stand a chance because they're splashed all over your mini-map and appear clearly, even behind objects, with big red icons over their heads. And then there's the plot and characters. Unfortunately, no one's come up with a mod to make the plot or characters any more interesting, and no amount of HUD removal or weapon modding is going to help me give a damn about any of the characters and what's happening to them. Even your own, annoyingly vocal, character, Jason, is a hateful adolescent (not in years, but in behaviour), and his friends are all stereotyped air-heads with no substance. I get the feeling there is more to the story than it first appears, and there's some kind of 'Alice in Wonderland' sub-plot going on (I've avoided plot spoilers), and that maybe there will be some kind of Fight Club-style reveal where it turns out Jason is actually Vaas, and vice-versa. But you know what? I just don't care any more. I'm about 8 hours into the game and have deliberately avoided following the story, not only because it's weak and the characters are hateful, but also because it means I'm likely to have to sit through endless boring cut-scenes, or stupid, arcade-style mini-games, or encounter the nemesis of any immersion junkie like myself, the dreaded quick-time event (seriously who actually LIKES quick-time events? Who buys a game and says to themselves, 'oh wow, I hope this game has LOTS of quick-time events). Why can't developers just let us PLAY the game, instead of constantly forcing our actions, or taking away our control all together. Valve and other progressive developers have proved time and again that you can have both a great game and a great immersive experience without compromising your in-game freedom, so why is there still this obsession with trying to turn games into movies? I probably shouldn't review the game before I've finished it, but I've just started re-playing BioShock to remind myself what a good, immersive first-person experience feels like (HUD elements and all!), and to prepare myself for the release of the next BioShock game, so the chances of me going back to FarCry 3 before BioShock Infinite comes out are slim. It's a damn shame, because there are loads of things to love about FarCry 3; the hunting, the expanse of the island, the superb AI, the weapons, the beautiful graphics, the best motion-capture acting in a game (Vaas), but all of that can only last me so long, and I just don't want to be in the shoes of this character any more. I'd rather put Jason's friends out of their misery and explore the island. With mods, such as the removal of the HUD and the improved weapon selection, I'd give the game a 6 out of 10. A better story would have probably meant an 8 or 9. But the vanilla game deserves nothing more than a 1, because developers need to realise that you just can't treat your audience like imbeciles.",1,PC
"When joking about about Far Cry 3 with my friends, I like to call it Call of Cabala: Modern Hunter. The name fits it perfectly. Plenty of Call of Duty style shootouts with the occasional hunt, be it man or beast. If only the story had the depth of either of those series, I might have enjoyed it a little bit more. I can overlook poor AI (it's pretty bad), can care less about graphics (which were beautiful), and grind through chores to get practically necessary unlocks (there are plenty of those), but a poor story kills a game for me. Let's start with what I found positive: most of the games mechanics worked, the open world was somewhat interesting to explore, and the graphics were very nice. But I found much more to be negative. The stealth mechanics were awful. I would often hide in a bush with a silenced weapon and pick off targets from a distance. But if anyone saw the death or found a body, they ran straight towards the bush I was hiding in, often discovering me. And you'd think men with guns would be the most dangerous enemy, but in reality it's the unnaturally tough animals. I've shot tigers in the head and they seemed unfazed. I think Komodo dragons spawning behind me was my number 1 cause of death. Number 2 being the poor attempt at creating platforming. You'll fall off an edge few times thinking you haven't quite reached it yet, only to die. And the story didn't draw me in at all. It was shoddy and, up until the very end, predictable. Moments that were supposed to make you feel sad or uncomfortable just made me laugh. Overall, if you prefer mindless firefights over storytelling, then this is the game for you. But if you're looking for the whole package, look somewhere else.",4,PC
"Underwhelming and over hyped. Once the world opens up to you, the game becomes a series of tedious exercises in collecting plants and animal hides to work around the ridiculous caps on money, ammo, and equipment the game saddles you with. Worst part about the crafting system is the specificity of materials required for a given upgrade. For example, collect two hides of species X for the first upgrade. Congratulations! Next, collect two hides of species Y who is only found on the other side of the **** island! Why does the same item require leather from a specific sub species of tapir when boar hide was good enough for the first upgrade? The map doesn't tell you which animal icons are what animal, so most of the time it's blind luck you're after the right one. The side missions are silly mini games that undercut the atmosphere of gritty survival the game attempts to conjure. Much like Far Cry 2, stealth **** because enemies instantly know where your position is even when using a silenced sniper rifle. The story is terrible and I could give two **** about the main character and his obnoxious friends. I'm tired of open world games that craft a visually stunning world with the promise of exploration and adventure only to populate it with tantalizing caves and abandoned buildings whose only point of interest turn out to be a wooden crate with a shark tooth necklace and absurdly repetitive side missions/farming tasks. Also, no predatory cat should be able to withstand half a magazine 7.62 rounds from an AK-47 when it takes two rounds to down a human NPC. It's like Red Dead Redemption's cougars all over again.",4,PC

"There are two adjectives to sum up the overall experience of playing Far Cry 3: beautifully boring. Far Cry 3 is a lovely game to look at whilst playing, mostly. However it's performance suffers immensely due to the demanding graphics. I have other games in my inventory that look just as good as Far Cry 3 yet they yield a much more enjoyable performance from my desktop PC. This game is demanding on system specs and playing with full graphic settings requires a system that would likely be overkill even for the infamously demanding game titled ArmA. The game play is lousy. I have played many shooters and the worst one I have played to date is Kane & Lynch, the reason for bringing up that title is because Far Cry 3 feels like the horrendous shooter that Kane & Lynch turned out to be. When I buy a video game I always play it at its highest difficulty setting. Difficult does not exist in Far Cry 3. I finished the game, playing a few hours a day, in under a week. I like a challenging shooter that requires tact and finesse. Far Cry 3 is a lousy shooter. It is too easy to aim and noticed several times that my aim doesn't need to be true in order to get that head shot kill. Throughout the entire game I felt as if I were playing a shooter with a Nerf gun. The warring experience never felt legit or realistic and most of the time it feels like a cartoon. Furthermore the game is far too easy to play and even worse is that the AI is always predictable and boring and never provide any challenge. Don't even get me started with the mechanics of the AI! If you make some commotion near an enemy camp, even whilst well hidden from a vantage point, the AI always comes looking for you towards your general vicinity. They don't span out and scour the entire area around the camp to find you, they come directly to where you are hiding but even though they come straight for you they are often easily repelled and after five minutes the enemy camp is free and friendly AI start to spawn instantly. Do this over and over and over again. The aspect of freeing the island of enemy camps feels like a chore and the job quickly becomes boring and increasingly non-challenging. The story is the saddest part of Far Cry 3. Did a grade 6 student write this during his free time? Far Cry 3's storyline is absolutely appalling and lame. The cut scenes are impossible to skip which is incredibly frustrating because the story is weak and the voices are poorly acted, also the cut scenes are often way too lengthy. This game feels like a movie. If I want to watch scripted scenes I will watch a movie. I play video games for the challenging aspect that the game should provide. Far Cry 3 however provides no challenge with its game play. It is a mediocre shooter at best with clumsy controls that are not user friendly for the keyboard/mouse players. All this garbage and nonsense is all wrapped up in the beautiful scenery which efficiently camouflages the game's flaws. If you like a pretty video game. Go ahead. Far Cry 3 is for you. If you're a true gamer looking for a challenge, stay well away from Far Cry 3. This is one game that will be collecting dust on my shelf along with all the other games with poor re playability.",4,PC

The multiplayer is just a waste and should not have been done at all considering the wretched state of the singleplayer. Fail! Simple as that Fail..............Fail........................Fail! The only part that was good were the old maps done by Crytek oh so long ago. And then with Ubisoft's help they flash and light in and out. Box game and should have stayed that way!",1,PC
"Another overpriced dumbed-down console shooter. About 75% of the spoken dialogue happens to be the word **** I can't imagine how I could be so dumb to pay 60$ for this idiotic piece of society-stultification. As the game market left the PC behind, it also left class and intelligence behind.",1,PC
"What's all the hype about? Boring, Stupid A.I and yes! another broken console port. The game has been broken since release with a micro stutter that nvidia and amd users are both experiencing. My guess is, ubisoft won't even bother to fix it, why break with tradition, right ubisoft?? I quit playing half way through the first island, I couldn't take it anymore. Ubisoft continues their tradition of releasing broken games with this disaster. Aside from the broken port, it's just not fun - Bad A.I, and just a piss poor implementation of an open world game. Pass on this game, until you can get it for 5 bucks at a garage sale.",0,PC
"Another prime example of mass produced casual garbage. That's what happens when you start producing games assembly line style. Games aren't shoes or tv's, a good game requires more than just putting pieces together in the same way that good music is made up of more than just sounds. Yes, technically music is just sounds, yet without vision and creativity that's also all it will ever be. Far Cry 3 is just a compilation of things and ideas that were copied and stolen from elsewhere thrown together, it lack's both creativity and vision and it shows at every corner. Far Cry 3 isn't an immersive masterpiece full of wonder, it's a compilation of mini games placed on the least immersive island ever conceived in video game history. It offers not even the slightest illusion of being a real place with real people. Everywhere is blinking crap and money lying around. Each 20 people village got a weapon dealer, and cars are waiting at every corner for a new owner. And the least immersive thing of them all, the blinking weapons and ammunition vendor machine! Yes, you heard me right, a weapons and ammunition vendor machine that even blinks! Holy crap! That thing beats it all, I don't believe I ever saw something more immersion breaking in a video game than this blinking vendor machine! So there we are, the least immsive island in video history and a complete lack of creativity and vision. And it gets even worse. Yes, surprisingly, it's still possible to get worse! I'm talking about Ubi and their desire to make games more accessible. For those who don't know already, accessible when it comes to game design usually means that anyone without any skill or even a working brain should be able to play it without difficulty. And that at least they managed, it's so easy and simplified that anyone not fully brain dead yet should take care not to play for prolonged periods of time or their brains might really die out of boredom. All in all, it's a prime example of mass produced casual garbage. Just what I expected from Ubi.",1,PC
"This game is everything I'd hoped it wouldn't be, but expected it would be; dumbed-down, hand-holding trash, clearly designed with fans of generic console shooters and people with 2 digit IQs in mind (although the two are largely synonymous). I can't really see how anyone could justify paying $60 for this game; the main story takes about 10 hours to complete (like a number of AAA games these days), the multiplayer is very mediocre, and on the whole, there is practically no replay value. Most of the game's features that are somewhat interesting are soon revealed to be nothing more than gimmicks. Prior to playing the game, I was very excited for the hunting/crafting aspect of the game, and while it was admittedly quite fun hunting exotic animals to craft bigger and better equipment, crafting everything only takes about 2 hours. After which point, there's no need to hunt another animal ever again (unless you're a sadist), as the animal skins are practically worthless. Unsurprisingly, the various animals soon become nothing more than an annoyance. Moreover, any real difficulty that could've been associated with hunting is ruined by being able to tag animals with your camera, and track them anywhere (in real time). There are some boring Path of the Hunter side quests (go here and kill x number of a certain animal), but with the ease and rate at which experience points and money both come, there's no need to ever bother with any of them. Capturing bases is also quite monotonous; due to dim-witted and illogical AI, capturing a base ""undetected"" is incredibly easy. You'd think if an enemy found a body with a 50 calibre bullet-hole through its head, they'd raise the alarm, right? Wrong. All that happens is they enter an ""alerted"" state, where they begin to scour the premises for the intruder (i.e. you). Even when they're in this state, you can still kill them (with even a grenade launcher, if you so please), and so long as no-one's stared at you for 5 consecutive seconds, it's counted as capturing the base ""undetected"". Oh, and as if it weren't easy enough already, you can track enemies with your camera too, in real time. Ridiculous. These are just a few of Far Cry 3's ill-conceived design implementations. Others include: merchants deciding to give you free weapons after you climb up a radio tower (?), everything important flashing bright yellow (as if you were too stupid to determine a loot chest from a cardboard box), and being able to see the location of every ""collectible"" on the map (which really defeats the purpose; instead of trying to find ancient ruins and secret passages, you know exactly each of them are, and it just becomes dull travelling and fetching). The story is incredibly cliched, and has terrible character development; a kid who has ""never shot anyone before"" can fire an gun at 100% accuracy with no recoil as soon as he picks it up. There are some Alice in Wonderland quotes thrown in that are supposed to mirror the story, but end up coming off as cringe-worthy. Regardless, I'm sure they'll impress idiots and pseudo-intellectuals alike. Even towards the end of the game, I didn't care about the Rakyat at all; I often killed them as soon as they drove into my newly-captured base just so I didn't have to listen to one of them tell me to check out the bulletin board for the 20th time. Graphically, the game is nothing really special. Serious LOD discrepancies, especially with distant objects, and flickering textures and shadows make the game look very sub-par. Some objects do not even have distant levels of detail, and just dissolve in from thin air when you're a certain distance away. Bloom lighting makes everything overbright, however, the sun-glare effect is very nice. Also, the visuals during hallucinogenic drug-induced scenes are very impressive. After completing the main story and capturing every base, there's effectively no point in continuing to play, since no enemies remain on the island, which makes free roaming incredibly boring. There is also very little replay value, since it's incredibly easy to gain every skill, and the stealth approach is almost always preferable to going in guns blazing. Conclusively, I'd only recommend getting this game to someone who has a lot of money to waste, and wants to be entertained for 10 hours or so before never playing it again. There are much better open-world shooters out there, such as the GOTY Edition of Fallout 3, and GTA IV, which cost about a quarter of the price and last more than four times as long.",3,PC
"I like the way the game was set up, but I find it saddening that I can only play the game on a pc, and I believe that this game should also be for macs.",2,PC
"The first 2 hours I played this game I thought it could be pretty good. I wanted to be able to carry more items, so I decided to start it by crafting some bags. As it turns out, I only needed to kill 4 of each animal to craft everything, so animals become useless pretty early. While I was doing that, every 2 minutes or so, a pop up shows up in the upper left corner reminding me of the quest I could be doing. Its like the game believes I forgot what I should do instead of letting me play it however I want to. Trying to ignore that, I proceed by climbing some radio towers to unlock the map. After climbing 4 towers, I have a free light machine gun, sniper rifle, flamethrower waiting for me at every item shop. Also, I can heal myself whenever I want. The enemy pirates (all dressed in red so you dont confuse them with the good guys, which wear blue) dont stand a chance. Having played 2 and a half, maybe 3 hours of the game, I dont see why I should keep playing. I already have way too strong weapons, crafted everything I needed (Im lacking some hunter path items or something, but I have enough capacity as it is) and the unlockable skills dont look very interesting. I mean, why would I care for reloading 25% faster when the game is really easy as it it? I dont know, the idea of being a survivor in a dangerous island had potential, but for me it is ruined by having huge weapons from the start, ammo and money everywhere, the ability to heal to full health by cracking my thumb, useless wild life, lame AI (they dont spot you unless you let them see you for 10 seconds or so, and if you block their line of sight before that, its like nothing happened.), boring characters and repetitive gameplay. I wanted to like this, maybe try again with the survivor idea?",4,PC

"Ambitious but rubbish. The opening sequence of this game was so tight, captivating, well scripted and visually impressive that you think you're in for a perfect game and after that it turned to a milquetoast shooter that is easily forgettable. graphically this game is pretty impressive. the island the flora and fauna are equally impressive, but the game play is so repetitive and simplistic. for instance once you get a silenced sniper rifle the game becomes whack-a-mole. Find and elevated position (and there always is an elevated position) snipe from a distance and look at a bunch of disoriented ants run around because you shot the alarms to disable it. the skills are mostly useless. this game lacks depth, it tried to do everything but never developed itself.. the biggest issue that i have with this game is that it COULD have been so good. more weapons, more connections with the locals so you care about the island you're saving. better crafting, for weapons armor etc. also the vehicle controls are horrible. The AI is laughable, they go to the same places as their dead comrades and you just blast them again. i will say that the comments of the main character as you go along are refreshing, there are times when you do something awesome in a game and the character is silent, when you wish they understood the gravity of what just happened. overall not worth the price, and mostly just frustrating for what it could have been, and the moments of brilliance are not enough to carry this title.",2,PC

And now Far Cry 3: 1) One hour to get it started 2) only playable if you disable the utter unneccessary uplay 3) worse graphics than FC1 (from 2004!) 4) most annoying UI sever een in a major release 5) boring missions 6) even more boring side-missions 7) laughable AI 8) idiotic design decisions like getting free weapons for climbing radio towers - WTF? 9) unskippable video sequences 10) appalling driving mechanics 11) no quick-saves during missions and 12) BUGS BUGS BUGS!!

"This is undoubtedly one of the best games released this year, and a game of the year contender. Every single aspect is near perfect. First let me tell you about the campaign. It is one of the bet narratives in a game I have ever played, and has some pretty serious subject matter and themes. If you're a COD kiddie then you need not apply. This game is not a hyper linear blockbuster shooter, it is an open world game, and you certainly aren't shipped around to every place on earth and left there for ten minutes. You are given ONE incredible place to explore, with tons of things to do. The open world is incredibly fun to explore, and there is loads of satisfaction in capturing an enemy base, or upgrading your character through hunting and crafting. Campaign: 10/10 Then there is the multiplayer, which is not particularly innovative but still definitely taking a look at. There are a few modes and features that aren't in other games. PLUS, it has a map editor, which allows people to make their own maps and submit them to the world, which ensures almost unlimited content. Multiplayer: 8/10 Then there is the co-op which is fun distraction, with it's own little storyline. It isn't long, only about six hours, but that six hours that you have is a very good piece of entertainment. Co-op: 9/10 The verdict: Far Cry 3 is a huge game, and if you run out of things to do in it I have one message: GET A LIFE. This game has enough content to last almost forever. GET THIS GAME.",0,PC

"I can not express how utterly disappointed I am with this game. It is a complete waste of time. First of all, it's far too easy to die and there's really no reward for staying alive except to circumvent respawning in some random location with an indeterminate amount of progress lost. It is literally impossible to figure out how much progress you've lost short of referencing how much ammo you have when your last save loads compared to how much you had before you died. Second, the enemy AI is horrible. You can shoot them with a silenced rifle from 1000 yards and they will, in most cases, establish your exact position immediately. Third, after you upgrade all your bags from animal hides, animals cease to have a purpose other than ambushing you while you're trying to sneak up on the enemy. Fourth, I've actually lost missions and had to load a previous save because my AI controlled ""allies"" randomly showed up and killed the person I was supposed to assassinate. Fifth, there is only one active quest at a time. You are never allowed to pursue more than one goal at any given time and despite supposed ""updates"" the game will remind you of your current mission objective with a huge pop-up every two minutes. The list goes on and on. But these aren't minor things. These are game-breaking flaws that completely ruin the experience. It's like this game was play-tested, but never fun-tested.",4,PC
"As much I've looked forward to this game and tried to give it a chance, I am not enjoying Far Cry 3. Starting with the positive: the game looks good, the day light looks great and the environment is vast and rather varied. There seems to be a lot of missions and some of the action scenes are quite good fun. However, this game is nowhere near the quality of other recent games such as The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (heavily quoted by the makers of Far Cry 3 as an influence on the game) or, say, Batman: Arkham City for the state-of-the-art action gameplay. Instead, Far Cry 3 delivers a 'deja-vu' experience, peppered with some novelties (wild animals interactions, distractions, etc.). The AI isn't bad but attacking a guard post is an extremely similar experience to Far Cry 2. There are some graphical glitches which also tend to break the immersion at regular intervals. But above all, it's the evident lack of taste in Far Cry 3 that's the most disappointing. You would think the developpers would have tried and topped Far Cry 2's overly simplistic, borderline racist plot line. Well, no they haven't. The story in Far Cry 3 is laughable, I cannot believe a single second of it. Dialogues are poorly written and acted out, nothing makes sense, the characters aren't at all three-dimensional. Everything goes too fast, it's shortcut after shortcut. People just send you on random erranands as if no-one else in the world was capable of blowing that ammunition depot. The vilain is a vilain because he is bad and that's what he does (being bad). You play the young white American who's turning into this unexpected master of violence to save your friends who are being held captive for some obscure reason. If you've enjoyed the intricate plot lines of the likes of LA Noire, Dishonnered or Skyrim, then you'll laugh your head off at Far Cry 3's lame attempt at a story. Many elements of gameplay also break the illusion and ruin a good part of the fun: Jason walks super-fast. Running or swimming will remind you of the speed mode of Crysis 1's Nanosuit. Also, looting is badly designed: you can't choose what you loot from bodies, and therefore end up carrying all sorts of crap which you don't need or want. Emptying your inventory of this crap is the most tedious task - you'll haveto point-and-click 4 times per item you wish to remove. And that's something you have to do all the time. Also if you're hoping to enjoy visiting the island like you did in Crysis 1 or like you would explore your surroundings in GTA, think again. You can't lower your weapon, which means that when you're just looking at the landscape or plucking medicinal plants, you'll have to do that which a machine gun in front of your face. You can't walk slowly either, which is particularly ridiculous when people go 'follow me' and you have to try and stay behind them although they can walk but you can only run. In short, Far Cry 3 is yet another shooter with a dreadful story (other reviewers have called 'offensive' and I can really see why). It will please immature players who just want to look at candy and run over tigers in a jeep, but if you're looking for a rich and intelligent gaming experience, save your money.",3,PC

Player has no choice in the story and when they do, they are forced into a false dichotomy and deux-ex-machina twists that are just pointless. Because they have nothing better to say they just do knee-jerk twists that end up with a knife in somebody's throat, this happened like 4 times. It often quotes Alice in Wonderland but it fails to capture the actual message of Alice in Wonderland by falsely creating two archetypes for a character, that is, mad jungle-man and respectable civilized man that the character is pushed into without their consent.

"All I gotta say is UBI lost a really great customer, i had high hopes and expectations but it let me down.. The SP is pretty neat but can use some work like the whole upgrading using animal skins and organs, not that i'm scarred of it but because it seems rather lame (same goes to not being able to skip cut scenes-LAME), there's also when you go to do a mission once you enter the mission zone you cannot leave the area until its been completed or mission failed. One more thing, you can't save and expect it to save the spot that your at/in you have to finish a mission then it will successfully save your progress. As for MP I would like to start of with server names, whats a server without its own name? its more of a room, second you cannot host a dedicated server nor can you have admin privilege's of your own server, UBI servers take care of all the voting and banning not the players, also no lobbies. What's an action game without any aumo piles around on the custom maps? how am i suppose to refill my gun with aumo? die and revive? The servers and game themselves do all the work for you like choosing a server, you can't join a server and expect its gonna be the right server (the one with all your friends in it) also my connection cannot even support this game, this means i have a fully paid for game but the connection will not work simply due to the fact my latency is far too high. I ran away from COD games a long time ago and this game feels alot like COD (in MP mode) and with that it makes me an unhappy camper. There is no more LAN like FC2 had but you can always play COOP via ubisoft servers but you can't play it on just your network/LAN.. I'm upset with it, thought it was gonna be awesome, thought it was gonna be much more interesting than the old FC2 but its not one bit.",0,PC
"Honestly this game is a 4 at best, it is NOT skyrim with guns (whatever dimwit came up with that needs to be ended), or the best fps ever, or even very much fun. The user score on here disgusts me. So this is basically 3 games using 1 engine.. the story, the co-op, and the multi-player. The multiplayer is straight up garbage, theres alot of multiplayer FPS games that do it so much better than FC3 that it was kind of stupid to even waste $ developing it when they could have made the story or the co-op better (so that alone=NOT A 10!). The co-op is i guess ok IF you have 3 others to play with, but the structure is stupid and with less than 3 you are totally fighting an uphill battle (not FUN). It gets repetitive REAL fast and you find yourself asking ""why not just play borderlands 2?"" or any of the other games that AGAIN do it so much better. Again this was a waste of development $'s though if they had gone for a completely different feel (like dead island or borderlands) it could probably have been quite alot of fun. So right there thats 2/3 game modes that are garbage (and that means it cant even be a 7/10). The story mode.. IS ""ok"". it looks nice (though i feel like it would bend over for rico to be as awesome as just cause 2) and the gameplay concept is good, it really is a handsome game. The mechanics are FILTH though! The crafting is just a system to make bigger storage containers for various munitions and some other things (arrows, heal potions, various combat buffs), its NOT like you can craft more than 1 bag or sell anything you have crafted though. The whole process of killing things and then looting their skins (or anything else really) is completely destroyed by the idiotic hit boxes that the carcasses have which means looting is NEVER fun! You mostly spend your time trying NOT to swap weapons that are laying on the ground NEXT to the body you are trying to loot, or trying to target the BEAR (yea.. a fkn bear carcass should ALWAYS be really hard to target..laying on the ground ...dead) to get his skin. You can sell the skins and plants you pick (hard core survivalists always run around picking flowers..) but there isnt really too much $ in it and until you craft a bigger bag its a real pain in the ass to carry such things around. The A.I. is probably about that of a deaf ****, I throw a rock 3 feet away it ignores it, i stare at them from in a bush they cant see me (even when i reload 2 feet away from them...) i have literally taken out entire outposts hiding in the same bush. If you dont like how your plan is going you can always run away (from outposts anyways, some of the instances obviously you cant) and come back later (after buying more ammo for your sniper rifle) and pick off the stragglers (provided you make it a point to shoot all the alarms. i think i was more afraid of the animals because of their unpredictability than i was the actual enemy soldiers. The whole thing with shutting down towers to get guns was also a real dumb idea, step 1: deactivate every tower on the first island and then go claim all your free guns and upgrade them, step 2: repeat on second island. I can ALMOST buy it letting you have NEW guns, but why would they be free? and beyond that THE SIGNATURE GUNS MAKE ALL OTHERS GARBAGE ANYWAYS! Positives, not gonna lie there are some. The characters are very interesting and have magnetic personalities... well the main ones, not all the red-shirts you mow down. There are alot of minigame type things to do (though most are pointless since you dont really need money for much aside from ammo) for...those people (the sad examples of ""gamers"" the game was obviously intended for). There is also something to be said in that i never got the ""kill all the black people"" feeling i got playing far cry 2. It runs fluidly on my system (which kind of tells you anyone who it DOESNT run smoothly for either doesnt have the hardware to be playing it to begin with or needs to get their drivers/redistributables in order) and looks nice, 3d support isnt great though. Overall, again its a 5/10. 2 modes are crap and the remaining one should have a ""games for ****"" sticker on it (though it will no doubt appeal to the skyrim crowd.. skill-less, tasteless, **** that they are). The only redeeming features are eye candy and a good cast of characters who are superbly voice acted (which is THE LAST THING I CARE ABOUT WHEN I BUY A FPS). Im glad i only paid 35$ for it, because anything more would be a ripoff.",0,PC
"Let's start off with the multiplayer-aspect. The guns all feel the same. What I mean by that is that it feels as if they've all got the same recoil and there doesnt seem to be any bulletdrop. You learn that one recoil and then you can adjust your aim to it no matter if you're using the heavy mg or a pistol. Other than that all the maps are basicly the same. There's like a hotzone in the middle and you can run around it - there it is. When a match is over and you're the best player on the winning team you can decide to either punish or spare the best player in the opposing team. That's about the only cool thing with the multiplayer-part. I'd sum it up as a **** clone of Call of duty-multiplayer - and im not even a call of duty fanboy. The single player was pretty fun when I started. The story was compelling enough for me to get interested in the antagonist and the main character (yourself) but once you got out of that first ""zone"" it all got worse. I thought that the survival-aspect seemed cool in trailers. But that was because I expected that the main character would have to collect eatable plants, hunt animals etc in order to survive. But nope. That's all part of some weird and huge unlock-system. You can make a backpack out of 2 X meat from animal Y. That animal is marked on your minimap so there's no way that you can miss it. The same goes for all the plants. Just look at your minimap and all you need to do is go there. It's an open world but since EVERYTHING is marked on the map it feels as if everything is already explored. You already know where everything is so there's close to no exploring. Sure, you can climb up a radiotower and the hotspots will become even more apparent to you (they actually show you how the place looks from an angle, instead of just the marked spot). And if that wasnt enough the AI is beyond stupid. You can throw rocks to distract the AI, you've got an infinite amount of rocks and you can do it a billion times. Each time the AI goes ""WHAT WAS THAT?!"", each time just as surprised as the previous time you did it. Their reactiontimes also seem to be really slow. They aim at you and after about 5 seconds they start shooting. I guess this is some setting that would help console-players to kill their enemies fast enough but on a PC it's incredibly easy to get the kill before they actually start shooting. Eventually the story just spins into a cliché and I totally lost interest. Stopped playing after about two hours of playtime. I doubt I will play it again. The co-op was repetative and easy (on the hardest difficulty). The co-op is not like single player. You're on a rail on one specific ""mission"" at a time. It's not even a story, you go get a bomb, place it and then you go to spot X. Mission complete and you go back to the lobby. All in all a really crappy game. It gets 2 because the voiceacting was better than average.",2,PC
"This game has a case of consolitus. Allows you to reconfigure WASD-movement keys, but then reverts back to hard-coded defaults for some vehicles - better get used to using WASD if you're not using those already. Also doesn't work too great with high-DPI mice - sensitivity can be adjusted but only up to a point. There's also a bug that distorts mouse-response for fast movements at low-sensitivity values making it impossible to do quick 180s or use reflex-aiming - not pleasant if you're a hardcore PC FPS gamer. The HUD is mostly okay, but navigating the menus does get a cumbersome after a while. The checkpoint saving system I also found to be somewhat frustrating, it doesn't make it very obvious exactly when the game's been saved, and I've already had a few instances where I thought my progress had been saved and had to restart the game, but ended up losing some progress anyway. In the end, no matter how to good the game might be - after struggling with above issues for nearly an hour and then having to deal with servers being down, I felt like I was fighting the game itself more than the actual enemies and gave up.",4,PC

"I got this game and at first I was very excited, back to the jungle, finally. I thought at first as I watched the Jack Carver-esque army guy kill guards and escape while my character whined like a little girl about everything, that you would take over the role of said army guy. Then army guy gets shot and I realize I am going to be this whiny 16 year old that after skinning hundreds of animals still says eewee every time he does it. This game has a couple minor issues with the ai and mildly repetitive side missions, but aside from that, the game play is a solid 10. The guns feel really good, they sound amazing, sitting on the couch playing on the TV with a 360 controller and my amazing PC is a huge bonus, unfortunately he story, is downright ABYSMAL and seems to do everything it can to make you not want to play the game. My 2 year old could have written a better story. An easy fix would have been the 16 year old getting shot, and the 30 year old special forces trained bad ass brother going on a murderous rampage would have made a LITTLE more sense, but that's just me. Whoever made the decision on that on should be beaten severely. He constantly complains while effortlessly killing hundreds of people like it is what he was born to do. I just do not see how someone could possibly think that would be a good design decision. Now on to another note, the game does have a co-op mode with actual BELIEVABLE characters. The only reason I gave this game any points was the co-op mode and probably the best looking jungle foliage I have ever seen (the big broad leafed plants look M-azing) and the sandbox elements are somewhat decent, and I still get a little scared every time I hear a tiger growl in the bushes or a bear growl, as they are as you would expect, extremely dangerous. The Breakdown: STORY:-20/20:The story in this game is so bad I have to give it negative points, as it just makes no sense and you are reminded of it every time the main character speaks, and I agree with Vaas, hes a little chicken **** How it is Jason, and not the older brother who was chosen as a main character is beyond me. Someone should be fired over that. It is seriously the rotten core to a majestic oak ****. GRAPHICS:20/20: The plats trees and shrubs look amazing. Light transitions are so wonderfully done I can feel my pupil dilating. Water is superbly done, with ripples on the surface looking and behaving realistically. The sun, sunrays, and reflections are some of the best I have ever seen and it runs wonderfully on a single 560ti and a 3820 @4.6 and 16 gigs ddr3quad 1866 on ultra settings 1920x1080. GAMEPLAY: 5/20- Gunplay is fantastic, combat is fun, and enemies are only mildly ****. The hunting mechanic is a nice diversion tho as soon as you get the extended pouches becomes completely irrelevant as you animal skins are worth less than a crumpled pack of smokes. SOUND: 15/20: The sound is really good, and I normally only mention audio if its bad. The gun sounds in particular are extremely realistic and oh so enjoyable, and make me feel like I am shooting a gun and not a string of black cats(firecrackers) Distances are accurate and I get scared hearing a tiger growling in the bush Only points subtracted for the girlish nature of the main characters voice. REPLAYABILITY: 0/20: As fun as the combat is, and as pretty as things look, I just do not see myself playing this game again if I even finish my first play-through. Side missions are incredibly repetitive, the story is just BAD, the main character is seriously the worst character ever, they should have just not had him talk at all. He literally killed this game for me and I really don't know if I will finish it once. TOTAL:20 out of 100. Final thoughts:I really have never been more shocked at any single gamplay element **** more than the choice of a main character in farcry 3 and that is rally just the tip of the iceberg as far as completely illogical unbelievable story issues go. This really would have been an amazing game if it just had a better main character, but as bad as Jason is it ruined the game for me. My girlfriend walked in while I was skinning something and asked why he was saying eew (apparently hes a little chicken **** **** asked if he did that every time(unfortunately), and wrinkled her nose like she smelled something bad and said ""really?"", its that terrible. I just do not understand why....thank god crysis 3 looks incredibly promising, or I would have sold off every bit of Ubisoft stock I own and invested it in Bohemia Interactive, which I may do anyway, since they still make computer games for adults, rather than take the creative dump that is farcry 3 and try to sell it for 59.99 (ARE YOU KIDDING ME). Pre-packaged DLC should just be called ""content"", not ""bonus material"". I will never buy any game that has a pre order bonus that is ""extra"" ingame content, nor did I buy this one.",2,PC
"I'm giving this game 2 points, and that's for the graphics. I was severely disappointed by the title. Ive long been a Far Cry fan, and loved nothing more than cranking up the difficulty and planning my strategy filled attacks on outposts. Well what this game did was take the things that separated Far Cry 2 from the rest of first-person shooters, and **** them. The excessive HUD and imbecilic AI turn you into a god, and every element of realism is eliminated. Money is so easy to obtain it's laughable; Dollar bills just laying around on every table in a poverty stricken island nation? Furthermore, the prospect of ""Free Weapons"" for just climbing a radio tower isn't logical at all. Not only that, but they remove weapon degradation and jamming, field surgery, and actual physical maps? Its obvious the developers noticed that a higher profit could be yielded if they literally dumbed down the title and removed any hint of sophistication as to cater to the 12 year-old COD fanboy demographic. It's as if the last true video game title made by a large developer has been ruined and turned into another over-cinematic arcade shooter (that has been so popular since the 4th Call of Duty) that requires no thought or skill (other than the famed ""no-scope"" that has grown so popular in the tween circles.) I can at-least be satisfied in that this game is going to bring the community one step closer to noticing the clear capitalistic motives of main stream developers that trump any motivation to create an original, good, game, and one step closer to relying on the indie developers that are creating today's innovative games. Now allow me to step off my soap-box. P.S If you're a 12 year-old console COD fanboy, do us true gamers a favor, and put your parents money toward something of quality (like meth, or cyanide), and stop ruining this industry.",2,PC
"I am going to be honest about this game's graphics, they are terrible. Not only does it look worse that the previous game, Far Cry 2, it looks like they actually did cell shading, after which they added a bunch of DOF, SSAO, Motion Blur, MSAA and DX11 just to attempt to appease computer snobs who like to brag about their systems. These effects do nothing to improve the already mediocre textures, bad cartoonish looking **** the water and water effects look like they were done with the Windows paint program. Let's take a look at a game like Dirt Showdown, for example, and compare it to this game. When you max out Dirt Showdown, you can really tell the difference, in Far Cry 3 you can't, but your computer takes a huge performance hit for no reason at all. Another game, The Witcher 2 (which is only directx9) the water effects in the Witcher 2 are absolutely stunning, because it looks like real water and when you step in water, there are ripple effects in the puddles, and that is only DX9! Another prominent example is Skyrim, the new textures they added are absolutely stunning, both The Witcher 2 and Skyrim look like they would be DX11, although they are not. When you are playing Skyrim and walking through Solitude, it feels as though you are actually in a real village, your character model looks impressive and you can see the detail on your armor and weapons. The rocks on the trails in Skyrim are impressive, and the water, though not as impressive as in The Witcher 2, still looks better than the 2D ""DX11"" water in Far Cry 3. Like I said, compare Far Cry 3 to any of these other games, and you will see what I mean. (P.S. compare it with the 2-3 year old Just Cause 2, and you'll definitely see what I mean).",0,PC
"As much as I tried to like this game, the extremely dragged out crysis experience ultimately forced me to give up on it. Enemy AI is laughable, stealth is terribly broken with ""the enemy must see your face and you must see theirs"" logic, gathering materials feels like an MMORPG grind-quest, healing system is dumbed down and becomes laughable as to either spend skill points to have an infinite amount of first aid that fully heals you after some time or constantly run around in the woods, looking for green herbs so you can constantly inject yourself with syringes. If you jump on say, a hill that's going two degrees down-hill, you will stumble and damage yourself, AKA dislocating your thumb for 1 bar of damage. If you shoot a silenced sniper rifle 5000 yards away, enemies will still rush to the exact spot where the weapon was fired. If you get knocked down by an enemy to the ground, struggle with quick time events and get up with low hp left, you will instantly die as the enemy will spam melees, effectively spawn-camping you. Yes, animals as well. I could go on and on and on about the countless amount of flaws and smelly design choices in this game but at the end of the day, it is a polished turd that has been dumbed down version of Far Cry that tries to be a cinematic version of Crysis with graphics with little regard to the original series as it tries to force-feed you a story using a wooden spoon with splinters. Stay away from this title as a fan or get into it with small/no expectations.",3,PC
wtf. this game **** right out of the box. what was ubisoft thinking? all they had to do was take farcry2 and add some new maps and story lines. wheres the system link? what about those of us who don't have high speed internet? we have been **** twice and had to reboot. i'm sure its filled with lots of bugs like that. it dosen't teturn to your last save. when a mission is completed all other enemy's disappears and you return to a safe spot unsure what happened. too much gagits not enough substance.,2,PC
This game aged a bit. Unlimited spawning copy-paste enemies get tiresome. I feel like they could have mixed it up a bit. AI is mediocre too. Worst vehicle control ever. Feels like you're driving on bald tires across a sheet of ice. The protagonist voice acting is bad and it pulls me out of the game. Voice actor sounds like a 15 year old with no gravitas. The rest of the voice acting is good though. The dialogue is bad at times. The villians are interesting and the gameplay is good enough for 15 hours of fun until the loop gets old.,7,PC
"It has a different and very curved story for its time, the graphics do not convince me at all, the atmosphere is good, but the graphics leave much to be desired, the gunplay is disastrous just like the setback of the weapons, it is as if you were fighting against the game not against the enemies, it is very frustrating to play in PC at least, the optimization is also quite bad, some of the miniof weapons are very feast 6.5/10",6,PC

"Okay, so I got this game for free during a 2021 event or something. The gameplay itself is pretty enjoyable, except for the annoying cutscenes. However, what really bothers me are the NPCs—they feel like a ctrl+c, ctrl+v copy of each other. 90% of the NPCs share the same model with only minor tweaks, like tattoos or clothing. There are a few weapons to choose from, but fewer than I would like. Overall, decent game but you can spot it was made by Ubisoft :)",6,PC

"The formula is complete. Ubisoft managed to take what was great from the second instalment and turn it into an absolute masterpiece. The story for FARCRY 3 Is incredible. The setting of a tropical island is a massive step up from the deserts and jungles from the second game. As soon as the game started with its opening cutscene, I knew this game was going to be good. The voice acting and actors they chose for this story kept me engrossed and I always wanted to see where the story was going to take me next. There’s a skill tree in this game and you are generously rewarded skill points. I was able to fully get all the skills before the story was complete and with all the skills and the knowing of how to approach certain enemies and situations, your basically unstoppable. The game is not that hard, but there was a few missions that stopped you from going in guns blazing and instead you are forced to be stealthy and that it self for me was difficult point to get past. You can distract enemies which makes it easier but if you have 6 enemies in the same spot then it’s hard to break them all up. There is a crafting system in this game, which by today’s standards is not daunting or difficult to get a hang off. Ubisoft have filed the map with animal locations that are visible from the menu map once you’ve synced up with the radio tower for that section. The crafting system tells you what animals to skin to get what you want and it’s generally that simple. There are hunter quests that unlock rear animals but there only used to craft the last upgrade for a item. The map is filled collectibles and different things to do so you’ll be able keep yourself busy, it does however get quite tedious. You have to climb loads of radio towers around the map and to get to the top of them there’s all different ways to navigate them. You can’t just climb the ladder to the top, it’s like a obstacle course that they’ve set up. The controls can be a bit janky at times especially the jumping so be careful when doing the radio towers because if you fall, depending on how high you are, you’ll probably die and have to try again. If you reach the top, you can synch with the tower and it’ll turn that section of the map visible and you’ll be able to see the roads, outposts, certain collectibles and more. There are loads of enemy outposts that you can liberate and once liberated they act as a fast travel option which is really good because the map itself is quite big so to get around more quickly it’s definitely worth doing these to unlock the fast travel system. the controls feel good, the gun are responsive and fairly accurate and you can upgrade your weapons to make them even better. The radio towers once completed will also unlock weapons for free in the shops around the map. So if you do all the towers you can actually unlock all the weapons for free except for the signature weapons then ones you have to buy. Overall this game is very good. Reason I have given it a 7 is because although the story is of good quality, the side activities is what brought it down. The side activities make up about half the time it takes to get 100% so half of this game is very tedious and not engaging at all. I would recommend to anyone who like first person shooters or to anyone who is interested in starting there FARCRY journey. This is a good game to learn the ropes of what was to come later down the road.",7,PC

"I played the game and finished it. The game is good, but I encountered technical errors in the game. Errors : -First of all, it is necessary to collect animal skins for development, but it feels as if the animals are teleporting in the places shown on the map. I realized much later on the first island that it was easy to find in side quests. - I said side quest, but side quests also have technical difficulties, for example, in an animal hunting mission on the top of the mountain, I found one of the escaped animals holding on to the rock facing down. It wasn't very pleasant. - On the second island, there was a problem in animations when trying to overlay the character's **** grip in one of the tower opening parts. When I tried to jump in, the character jumped over it instead of getting into the handle and threw himself down many times. Cons: -The upgrades are okay, except for weapon upgrades. - The weapon improvements part are as follows: While the attachment to the weapon is very limited, when too many add-ons were installed in the weapon specially provided by the game, I inevitably had a feeling of bitterness. -Boss fights weren't much fun for me. -The bad guys gave me the image of an ordinary crazy character. - The change of our much-mentioned main character, Jason, did not pass me by. For example, when collecting animal skins, it always felt as if he was disgusted doing it. - Even if I put a silencer on the gun, it felt like the AI ​​always knew I was there but pretended not to see it, and since there were armored men who didn't handle bullets, stealth didn't seem like an effective method to me. Pluses : The feeling of hitting does. It is very comfortable to drive. It's fun to burn enemies. Weapons are fun to use. Visual quality is good. My rating: 6 out of 10.",6,PC

The gameplay is cool, it's nice to shoot from a large selection of weapons (half and did not try xD), there is a craft of a fairly extensive number of things, flora and fauna of the game. The only thing I didn’t like was the empty open world in which there was nothing much to do except clear outposts of pirates and mercenaries, cut down towers and hunt, a bunch of extras. quests that are not very interesting to pass because of the routine. The game is 11 years old and this is not an indicator, for fans of the open world from the first person I advise you to play (especially after the 2nd part, it will seem like heavenly pleasure to you), fans of more corridor shooters should think about it.",7,PC

"Far cry 3 was released almost 10 years ago now. But with the modern far cry games being so mediocre, how has this one aged. Story: The best in the series (at least the best one I've played). Vaas is one of if not the best villain in video game history, however, he dies halfway through the game. The main character at first seems kinda generic but as you play through the game, he gets more insane. The story halfway through kinda gets boring. Overall, Vaas carries Far Cry 3's story and after he dies, the story just kinda gets boring but the first half of the story is so good that I can't rate it any lower than a: 7.8/10 Gameplay: What you would expect from a semi-modern Far Cry game. The first half is great. Vaas's pirates are really fun to kill and the jungle provides a lot of cover and the jungle is also just really fun to explore. The second half of the game, however, is just average. The jungle is replaced with a vast, open, and kinda boring landscape and the hilarious pirates are replaced with regular old military troops. Overall, its better than the modern far cry games in terms of gameplay but the second half is too disappointing to give it any more than a: 6.5/10 Graphics: When compared to today's graphics, they still somewhat hold up but also look a bit dated. The environments still look pretty good and give the illusion of a real island that people would live on but the lighting can be weird at times, the models that aren't main characters look straight up bad and NPC animations look kinda **** Overall the graphics look meh for today's standard but I'll be nice because this game came out 9 years ago. 4/10 (when compared to today's graphics) and 8.1/10 (when compared to 2012 graphics) Sounds: Horribly bit compressed and low res. Sounds like a game from the 5th generation of consoles. However, music-wise, it's not bad. 2/10 Overall, Far Cry 3 is my favourite in the series but that's not saying much since there are only 3 good Far Cry games. Far Cry itself mostly relies on gameplay, story and somewhat on graphics so the final score is 7/10.",7,PC

"The far edge could never go through to the end (too long and boring). After 10 years, I decided to go through it to the end and what can I say: the first part of the game still brings you up to date, it tells you ""I'm exploring the world"", but I don't want to do this at all, why? Because ""the world is inanimate!"" I thought for a long time that it was ""Action with RPG elements"", but no - in all stores and Wikipedia the game is listed as just ""Action"", so I became more loyal to it. ""game world"" / ""game mechanics"" - the game has been called ""cult"" by many experts for one of the reasons ""open world"", but what to do in this open world? Civilian NPCs are extremely rare, civilians in villages are 3-4 people and mostly silent, it is impossible to understand their ""TRAGEDY"", and just to understand what they are thinking in order to absorb the local world! It can only be seen that the island is with lazy anarchy, where Vasa people are trying to rule, and an aboriginal tribe opposes us against it (there is of course a 3rd party - ""mercenaries"", but despite their ent (they are also traffickers), they are only on their own separate island), but this war is extremely strange, weak aborigines hold a single village and a local archipelago, and Vasa people come across you at every step, you will kill them -kill-kill, because of this the world seems even more artificial. It seems even more artificial when you, traveling by car, meet an enemy patrol or a car on the opposite path, after you destroy them, another enemy car will pass ""purely by accident"" in a minute and you will need to destroy them - it all gets boring quickly, you begin to understand that the world is illogical even in the usual game understanding (where on a poor little island there are so many cars, so many people, who are many times more than the local population? Yes, they may be mercenaries, but why are they in such numbers? Rave! Even if it's not nonsense, they can't destroy the remnants of the resistance - doubly nonsense!). Because of all this, I couldn't feel myself in virtual reality, and it didn't work out to explore and enjoy the scenery because of all this. At the same time, the main problem of the game is that the enemies run in bright (red), which looks even more strange and it does not work to immerse themselves in the game! ""PLOT"" - The first part of the plot is normal, the second is boring, but the ending is even philosophical in its own way, not flared. But I played through the force, almost fell asleep, but the end even made me think about the general idea of the game, to understand the philosophy of action, but it is here without hidden meanings, but quite pleasant. It is impossible to call this game a ""benchmark"". How many new far cry did not come out, having the same gameplay, problems - they will not be able to jump to the 3rd part, because far cry 3 was more philosophical than it seems at first glance, but everything is not so rosy at the same time. After the passage, the sediment remains inside, which ending you would not choose, but attention is drawn to our choice and I want to understand the meaning of all the savagery of this island, the tragedy of people, but it will not work because: neither communicate with NPCs, nor talk to factions - it is impossible. Alas, the game is average lousy, but also pleasantly surprised me at the end.",5,PC
"Good game but when you're playing if you want open the map then game brings you to another menu, same with crafting. It reacts as you pressed esc button.

That being said, this is indeed a 2012 Ubisoft game. That means the graphics do not hold up, the shooting feels old and some side missions are literally just copy pasted and boring. Like I said, this is a good game, but it it is simply not worth the 30$ anymore. Why would anybody pick this over hundreds of games that have better gameplay, gunplay and stories?

"This is not a direction the series should have ever gone towards, no. Sequel to no other than Far Cry 2, we're now steered towards a new jungle setting, fresh breath of air for many. I used to consider this one of my favorites for a long time, but as I've played through it again, and again, and again, I have come to notice the serious flaws it carries. Starting from storytelling, it's laughable. They've created a somewhat iconic hollywood style story, which at the times was popular, but it misses the mark with plotholes, and failure to deliver anything the player would care about. Coming to the end of it, it's only positive parts had been some of the entertaining missions, and the world you experienced while at it. I never became too fond of the cast, neither could feel anything if something happened to them. It's incredibly frustrating, considering there are also so many good things to Far Cry 3. Visually, it's stunning, even for today's standards. It's something I couldn't get tired of, exploring the islands and finding secrets, more and more pirates and eventually ways to progress the story. Gameplay was something that made me feel, rather mixed about. There's lot of detail missing, and same goes to the overall game quality, over the previous installment, but for the ways of killing and moving yourself around, it's gone too simple, repetitive and easily exploitable. There is no real difficulty here. I'm personally not particularly good at videogames, but this one just feels, odd. You aren't punished enough, ever, neither challenged. I have to hand it to them, it's addicting at times, due to the smooth flow of the gameplay, which I did end up finding a positive together with the diverse arsenal, but it's not the mature thing that it should have been. Other points, such as audio and amount of content, and the state of the port, only reinforce my feelings towards this one not being the masterpiece people let it out to be. They aren't bad, but just not good enough for me not to consider this game average. I strongly believe it's that, and wouldn't recommend playing it. There are better alternatives out there, even on this franchise.",5,PC
"After the simplified and boring Far Cry 2, I said to myself, I will never try another Ubisoft made Far Cry game again. But then, Far Cry 3 was released and got such exceptionally high scores across the board, that I just had to try it out and see what's really going on. Far Cry 3 looks similar to Far Cry 2. There are some improvements, but the reality is, it doesn't look exceptionally good for a 2012 game. Once again, everything in the distance is out of focus due to some strange reason and there's some sort of haze in the air at all times. Ubisoft Montreal did learn something from their mistakes though, AI is a little bit better this time around, dead enemies do not resurrect constantly anymore, and they finally added a story to the game, which isn't even all that bad to be honest. They also added some innovative elements that weren't in the previous game, like hunting, crafting and upgrading abilities. Guns are OK and you are actually free to roam the map, or at least half of the map at a time. However, under the surface, we are looking at a barely improved Far Cry 2. Ubisoft Montreal managed to blow it yet again with shallow execution. Hunting is little more than a short minigame, since all you do here is kill a couple of each animal and you are able to craft all the items there are to craft. The money system is just as broken as it's incredibly easy to accumulate large amounts of cash, and there's nothing worthwhile available to buy with it, except for weapons. But wait, you get those for free anyway, with the help of another useless minigame, called switching on the radio towers. I found myself doing only three things the entire time, liberating outposts, switching on the radio towers and doing the main story missions, which are mostly too long and, with a few exceptions, not very well designed. Now that I've seen it, I have no idea why this game got anything but mediocre scores. I can see someone potentially enjoying Far Cry 3 as a mindless sandbox playground, but then again, there are better options for that on the market, such as the Just Cause trilogy or Grand Theft Auto games.",7,PC
Addictive and fun. Worth every penny!,7,PC
"The game on 4k is EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL, the capacity of fly around the map is the best, it´s like a crysis 1 remaked. It´s a shame that the main story don´t bring anything new and the secondary misions are too repetitive.",6,PC
"Decent, mindless time waster with bright, colourful visuals and solid gunplay and stealth.",6,PC
"Decent game. Story is good but most characters are not very charismatic, weapons feel ok, visually looks fine but performance is not the top tier. Map, progress and exploration are also fine. 5.5-6/10.",6,PC
Oh it could have been better. I have mixed feelings,6,PC
"Far Cry should never went in the semi open world direction, the game was better when it had a linear story. Game feels empty as a semi open world and become repetitive and boring after few hours, story is a downhill from the first one and the game design is much worse now, its more like a teen game and it lost its gory and horrific atmosphere. It not bad, but it has lost its identity to me and gave up on the series after this as it went in the wrong direction. Also worth noting that the game was never meant to have so much sequels but as usual the company will milk every successful game to the death to make $, Skyrim success is the reason for this game going semi open world and losing its identity and is a bad move imo. 5/10 an average shooter game, but not worth playing anymore for me,",5,PC
"Far Cry 3 is open world FPS with solid story and interesting characters. Although it could have been shorter, last third of the game felt boring compared to the rest of it.",7,PC
"Far Cry 3 A bit overrated Far Cry 3 is an about 16 hour long first person shooter where you play as Jason Brody The game starts with a bunch of young adults having fun and next thing you know, you and your little brother are in a cage, with the others nowhere to be found, this is where youre introduced to this games main antagonist vaas, who then shoots your brother, you run away and you spend the rest of the game trying to find your friends and get revenger for you little brother.. . I havnt played far cry 3 before, and with it being released for current gen consoles, being included in the far cry 5 season pass I thought I would go back and play the ps3 version.. after hearing such great things about how this game was robbed for game of the year 2012 by releasing in December.. I was even more excited for what is supposed to be the best game in the far cry series… And im sorry to break your hearts, but I just don’t see it.. And lets be real.. 2012 we saw the likes of dishonored, assassins creed 3, the walking dead season , lollipop chainsaw, borderlands 2, and journey… get out of here with that robbed nonsense… Is far cry 3 the best game in the series? If we don’t count far cry primal, it actually probably is.. that much I agree on.. though Ive never touched far cry 4… right off the bat, my eyes needed some adjusting.. im geunuinely surprised how bad this only nearly 6 year old game now looks.. I had to get used to the old school graphics to really immerse myself into the world.. thankfully after a couple of hours my brain and eyes did adjust and the negative critiquing ends there.. Because Far Cry 3 while is insanely overrated is stil la really good game what makes far cry 3 so great is that its so simple and linear… youre placed on a giant island is towers to climb to reveal the map.. its crawling with plants and animals to hunt so you can upgrade your gear, posts to liberate for fast travel points.. and the story is delivered with emotion and great design that we don’t get in the more modern far cry games I much prefer this delivery style over the recent separate regions, go do things to challenge the region leader nonsense they do now, it pulls everything in and makes It feel personal.. here youl lbe doing a variety of queststhat as you could guess involves a lot of shooting, with the occasional annoying stealth missions thrown in here… But it never feels like just busy work, I had fun through the whole campaign, and my favorite moments much like in far cry 5 were the moments where youre going through weird hallucinations… it’s a clever way to create unrealistic levels and bring them into reality and I appreciate that.. and completing quests will reward you with xp that goes towards skill points you can throw in your skill tree world design however is just okay, not much incentive to explore… it’s a bunch of greens and blues.. I didn’t feel like much care went into crafting it, but works as land in between missions, and does a great job of coming to life during the main story line.. A story that was again just kind of okay, none of the characters blew me away, there are some surprised in the story.. but nothing that really drew me in or pulled me through to the end.. the pure fun of the gameplay, the shooting, the tower climbing, the hunting.. that’s what kept me going.. there is also co op maps and online multiplayer here but beign a 6 year old game as you would guess theres not many people still playing and there isn’t much to say about it.. its just one of those tacked on multiplayer modes that every AAA ps3 game had Ultimately I enjoyed Far Cry 3 Its not as great as everyone remembers it being.. it doesn’t hold up.. but its still decently fun I give far cry 3 a 7.5/10",7,PC
"The story and characters were better than 4's in my opinion; with interesting elements coming into play. Plus the two main villains were excellent and fantastically voice acted. The open world was beautiful, and the gun-play was solid. But, I found the protagonist to be inconsistent, the boss fights were terrible, and the side activities got repetitive after a while. Although I enjoyed the game, I don't think it's as good as everyone says it is.",6,PC
"A rather interesting plot ruined the disgusting ending (the choice is not even important, they are both worthless).In addition, they do not allow the second option to see the second.Great idea to be disappointed a second time, I have to go through the game twice 12/10",6,PC
"I waited quite a while to play this game. My grand kids, who hated Far Cry 2, loved this game. Ironically, I thought (still do) Far Cry 2 was/is the best FPS I've ever played. It was flawed in many respects, but it ALWAYS kept me IN the world. You can get shot while looking at your map. You can look at your map and drive at the same time. Nothing was safe. I even complained about having GPS and found a way to turn that off. The game did not fair well. I wonder why (as I roll my eyes). Well, I have played FC3 and am on the south island and nearing the end of the game. I won't finish it. The game makes me fell like a grade school kid. It's ironic that a gamer will complain about FC2 because, ""the enemy can see me from a mile away!"" and then love FC3 where the enemy turns into little dots running around on your mini map. And people wonder what has happened to gaming. I don't blame Ubisoft, it's the gamers that are the problem. This is a little kids game.",6,PC
"Far Cry 3 was one of the most interesting game I have played ever. It features an innovative gameplay (for the time when it was released), a fascinating plot, good music, and, of course, awesome graphics! If you like FPS a lot, this game is must-have!",7,PC
"This game is average , because graphics in this game is bad , but storyline is good . This game is Action , but at the moments Stealth . This game is not one of the best game of 2012 . Far Cry 3 better than Far Cry 4 and Far Cry 3 interesting pass . 6/10 .",6,PC
Wake up please,5,PC
"The gameplay is mostly good and it's fun to hunt, to activate towers and to level up. Rarely have I had so much fun just walking, driving and exploring a world. BUT: The story is among the worst **** I have ever come across. Absolutely stupid and annoying. Very cliché and I didn't connect with my character or the ones around me even one bit. I was glad when it was over. 6 points for the amazing open world. 0 points for the story and characters. And 0 points for the checkpoint savegame system which is one of the worst ones I have ever encountered in a video game. All in all a lot of missed potential in this game. And that might be the biggest annoyance in all of this.",6,PC
"No details, there already have been enough comments about that. My biggest problem: The final stages of the game somehow didn't entertain me any more; it was quite a drag to actually play the last few stages. So I guess the fun is more in the exploring. The story is OK, but at the end it just drags on in my opinion.",7,PC
"The story is gratingly awful in every way. They try to sell it as satire, but it's just pure garbage. I'd get more enjoyment out of reading bad DBZ fan fiction written by kids. The combat is decent, if a bit shallow and repetitive. The game forces you to grind through the horrific pile of garbage story line to get to a better variety of weapons. If this game offered an unrestricted sandbox mode that didn't make you sit through the offensively bad 'story' I'd give it an 8.",6,PC
The devs did a great job on this one,7,PC
"The game is more stealth/adventure than action. I liked villain characters but heroes were not very interesting. The best character would be Vaas Montenegro who died foolishly and was not involved in the story that much. The story sometimes gets too slow and bores you and sometimes gets too fast and makes you upset. Rakyat people don't participate in freeing outposts and the player must do everything on his own. Side missions are many and useless. Graphics are very good, every event and place is designed with the most accuracy. You'll never get tired of exploring the jungle. There are many guns in different classes and there's even a crossbow which is very handy and stealthy. Each weapon may have some upgrades (like silencer) that you can buy from the stores. Skills are numerous and help you in the levels very much, including how to kill an enemy below you, how to kill a heavy gunner and so on. The game is interesting, for sure. But it would be much better if they worked on the story and characters a bit more.",7,PC
"The game doesn't run very well on a high-end AMD videocard (7900 series) - even at lowest settings it can become a slideshow at times (particularly while flying a kite and doing circles before you land) ... Apparently this game was tailored for Nvidia users and AMD users can pretty much go @#$! themselves. Classy, Ubisoft. I see this gem for what it is, though: if you ignore the minor inconveniences with crafting and having to bounce back and forth for components, this is a beautiful game. It would get an 8.5 if it didn't lag with a beefy videocard.",5,PC
"Basically a more open-world version Tomb Raider with some key differences. First, the narrative isn't nearly so tight. Second, menu navigation, tutorials and the like feel clunky and confusing. Third, too much narrative and opening exposition. I've been playing for an hour and all I've done is shoot a couple pigs and pick flowers. The narrative structure was executed top-notch in Tomb Raider, but in Far Cry 3 it's already feeling like work because the story is just too been-there-done-that. We didn't come to Far Cry 3 for story. We came to Far Cry 3 for action and great game mechanics, and if this game doesn't start delivering soon, into the trash it goes.",5,PC
"OK, Ubisoft, please answer me this : WHY ARE THE CUTSCENES NOT SKIPPABLE ?!?! Why do I have to sit and wait for X minutes and cannot just skip the boring lame animatios ?! The story really really ****, otherwise I would give it much higher score, but I could not even finish the game because I became allergic to the stupid boring cutscenes !!!!",5,PC
"This is a really good game excellent graphics still in 2014 but... the old problem, the outposts system.. it taked nearly 45 hours to finish this game i loved the story, gameplay is one step further than FC2. I really disliked the outposts system, i need a new recipe from Ubisoft. They are great of making videogames now they need to move a step further and create new innovative ways to explore their huge open worlds.",7,PC
"What's the definition of insanity? I think Vaas knows. Without him the game would have been without taste. Generally It's an acceptable childish game. The equatorial atmosphere is great but the places aren't so convincing. I didn't like the idea of saving my friends though. A serious mysterious story with a sublime goal would have been much better. The vegetation colors are exaggerated, so are all of those explosions everywhere and action generally. The graphics are bad compared with the previous version which is very rich in graphics. I enjoyed Far Cry 3 but I'm not playing it again. I think I'll play Far Cry 2 because I's balanced and complete in all aspects.",7,PC
"Great environment, reasonable combat. Crashes during save a lot. Strives for immersion but then proceeds to force QTEs down your throat such that you lose that immersion. On several occasions (not just once) you mow down an army of people and then a cutscene has you KOed by a simple hit and then you have to escape (again and again). Final mission is one big QTE that doesn't require any skill that you've been honing the entire game. The story is good until the middle when supernatural stuff (which breaks immersion again) gets stupid. Ultimately a good game if you ignore the story and the numerous immersion destroying moments.",5,PC
"Blood Dragon is much better game than this. Okay, I don't want to judge a FarCry's whole main storyline, but acting, dialogs - they are just awful. And Jason is a crying maiden used to talk to himself. AI is a crap, you can kill pirate without sound suppressor, hide near in a small bush - and his friends will forget about you in 30 seconds. And of course they wouldn't trigger the alarm, ""there is nothing to worry about"". Animals are not better - predators politely warn you with roar, tigers and leopards like to charge prey instead of real hunting. Watching a couple of komodo dragons wiping several patrols of arming men is funny. Quests like ""drive this car for 30 seconds from A to B"" or ""I am a poor woman living in a rubble pile but take this 500 dollars as reward"" are just indicate level of creativity put in this game. All that is good in this game - graphics and a relatively big world to explore.",6,PC
The game is a lot of fun from times to times. The island world is really beautiful and the cut scenes and npc acting is so great that it some times feels like beeing in a movie. The down side is that the island istoo crowded with enemy NPC:s (which consists of animals and guerilla warriors). You can't go any 100 meters in any direction without bumping in to a fight with something which destroys the flow that the game could have had. The multiplyer of the game is good but generic.,7,PC
"Two main reason I dropped this game: 1. Cheap and exhausting interface, either the developer team is dumb or barely put any effort into it. 2. Buggy, specially terrain reference... You're going to constantly stumbled unto some pebbles or terrain layer joints and have to jump over or press dash button again. Needless to say, it's annoying as hell when you have to deal such a thing in the heat of a battle. Other things like game broken bug - I encountered 2 place that get you stuck during one Monkey mission in the temple area. And finally a total blackout for no reason during a strong hold capture. Have those Ubi staff ever test play their f*cking **** Have they put the money supposed to go to the quality administration to make more promoting videos?",7,PC
"Very satisfying combat, but it gets boring when every outpost attack is the same. The story is pretty lame really, and all of the characters in the little side-quests are totally boring and I wish I could skip the dialogue. The feeling is this is somewhere between the Just Cause series, where the plot doesn't really matter and it's just a ton of fun to cause chaos on the island, and something more serious like Skyrim where the story is pretty deep and enjoyable.",7,PC
"I liked this game better then Far Cry 2, Far Cry 2 was too repetitive always the same situation shoot the truck over and over, even though this game was still repetitive it wasn't as bad as Far Cry 2. Pros *Graphics were good, jungle looked realistic (if a little too bright) *I liked the skill system *Good music *Nice variety of weapons shooting the animals in cages to kill off the enemy's was enjoyable Cons repetitive annoying animal quick time events game too short just 10 hours long bosses left me feeling sea sick the plane part where they attack from all sides was too difficult lastly animals taking 2 full magazines to kill even if aimed directly at their head was way too unrealistic I rate this a 5",5,PC
"Fine game, 7/10. Not the greatest experience, but kept my engaged somewhat throughout the game. The narrative did not seem coherent with the world. Made the experience suffer too much.",7,PC
"One of the few single player game I've finished. Far Cry 3 offers a lot of freedom, but none i would spend too much time on. I found myself speeding through the main story-line, ignoring all the other content. The hunts, and quests were just icing on the cake, which didn't appeal to me, but did present itself in more variety to other players. There were many exciting moments that kept me drawn into the game, but in the end, it was nothing to remarkable. Nonetheless, Far Cry 3 is still a good game in the most parts.",7,PC
"The game itself is addicting, the bugs however are the intervention. The game is legit a bug fest with frustrating game breaking issues that made me throw my hands up in the air and say eff it. When a game tells me to use the optimal settings (which are 1080p at max settings mind you) it should not look like its trying to drag itself out of a potato sack 3,000 miles to middle of nowhere. That's what the game does, drag out. I've hand multiple bugs, one of them looking like Missing-No from Pokemon Red and Blue Sprite popping up on my mini-map or textures. Long story short: THE GAME IS NOT READY AND WAS RELEASED WITH A NEST OF BUGS TO BREED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FIX THIS GAME UBISOFT.",6,PC
The biggest blank for the buck,6,PC
"I feel the game was overall enjoyable, I like the range of weapons and customisations to choose from and the stealth aspect was quite enjoyable and often a good option as on harder difficulties trying to fight multiple enemies became a challenge. However the story, which was promising, became very anti-climatic and lack lustre. I also feel the combat became far too easy when you could simply inject yourself with a syringe to instantly heal or even become invincible (no really) for about 30 seconds, and then pump another when that ran out. The quick heal option and the enemy tagging (which allows you to easily keep track of where enemies are as you can see them through walls) made stealth relatively easy. I found the hunting better than most games but it soon lost meaning as I crafted all the items that needed to be crafted there was no reason to return. Side missions were truly poor and the voice acting terrible for the minor characters. The main and supporting characters (like Vaas, Hoyt, Buck and Sam) are surprisingly well acted with real emotion in their voices and genuinely interesting characters. Overall the gameplay makes it quite enjoyable but the story and side quests let it down, and if your wondering how long it would take to complete my total gameplay hours were about 9 hours (and that was doing everything in game accept from collecting all loot chests/letters and relics).",7,PC
I can't say I did not enjoy the game but being more of a storyline guy I must say I got a little bored pretty soon.... I found the main storyline to be short and not at all surprising... No twists or anything.. On the bright side there are a lot of misc. things to do while you are exploring the map which indeed adds to the depth and and the timespan of the game... Hunting Exploring Taking Down Radio Towers and capturing enemy bases are just some of the things you can do on the island but I found that even these activities get a little boring after a while...,6,PC
"This game has been done before, better and with a much more polished feel to it. It's called Just Cause 2. Except that game ran a lot better, with half of the system requriements and yet with a great graphics. Again, I don't know what has driven game reviewers to give 90+ scores, since the game gets very old and very fast, doing the same thing over and over again. And the killing of animals and making various tools out of them to hold more ammo or more health packs is just ridiculous. Technically, it's an unoptimized mess if you ask me. glitches, ugly textures and weak AI. This game was already done years ago, better and cheaper.",5,PC
"First, I want to start with what I like. I like the variety of weapons, I like the island, and the various things you can go around and do to get money, XP, and materials for crafting. Sure, it might feel repetitive, but I'm one of those players that has no problem grinding if I feel like I'll get good rewards, in this case better equipment and skills. What's more is that you have the opportunity to do this early game and level yourself before having to progress through the story, making parts of the game much easier on yourself. My big gripe with this game has to do with overall sluggishness of the combat system and the unintuitive controls for a lot of different things. A great example would be animals who are predators. Yes, you can dispatch them relatively easily with a machine gun or something similar, but by doing that you risk alerting everything within 100 effing miles. While you get silent weapons as you progress, they're simply not meant for handling a pack of wild dogs, for instance, and your melee is so terrible that it's a huge pain to actually deal with this garbage. There's no reason you should have to work so hard for such a simple enemy. Hell, the guys who are supposed to be ""hard"" are easier to deal with. I'm also not a fan at all of having to ""hold"" a button to activate something. Why is it I have to hold E to loot something as opposed to tapping it like every other game? Not a clue. It makes a tad more sense when targeting enemies/creatures, but when you get noticed, why is it that the game can't just automatically target those for you? But, what really confuses me is how you can get hit out of other activities, like skinning an animal. If you start, you have no choice but to finish the action, no matter how many bullets they feel like putting in you. At least give me SOME sort of defensive action for these scenarios. And I can't tell you how much I hate driving in this game. I avoided vehicles for most of the game because of how terrible they handle. Basically, if I could run somewhere, I would do it even if it took me an hour. Thankfully, the fast travel system is really good in this game, so doing that wasn't too bad. (Dead Island has the same issue, too.) Why they couldn't make that 3rd-person is beyond me. I also LOVE doing takedowns... but I HATE how skittish the takedown system is. The system will often deny you a takedown with really no rhyme or reason. What's worse is that if you mess it up you're likely to eat a gun-butt to the face and then get pelted with bullets. Really, though, this ""skittishness"" is everywhere. Lastly, I hate the main character. It might sound stupid to some, but the guy you play looks like a preppy ****. I noticed some reviews saying how it really made no sense how this skinny, whiny dude can suddenly progress into a Rambo-esque monster... and I completely agree. It just pains me that I have to play this crappy character. It almost made dying so many times easier. (Almost.) Ultimately, I gave this a 5 only because I did get my money's worth. I happened to get the game on sale AFTER they lowered the full-price to $40 and I actually used credits for most of the purchase, so it wasn't too bad of a deal. I would've been pissed had I spent $60 on this game, and I would honestly recommend getting Blood Dragon over this game. Your character is way more awesome, which tends to make the system flaws far less noticeable, and the story is AMAZING. Go play that. Don't get this. (Or, at least, not for full price.)",5,PC
"The Good: A very good to great game engine, nice art, fun visual themes and environment. The Bad: Confused user interface, The game mechanics, economy, etc. are a bit week, but the killer is the game is tied to an inconsistent, forced, unbelievable, immature, and poor to bad plot that took this game down for me from fun to un-enjoyable.",5,PC
"Okay, but feels mediocre on many different levels. Replayability in the single player as much as people claim, is very low. Sure, it's open world, sure it has a small-time progression system with little crafting. But other than that, this is far from something like let's say skyrim. Not that I was expecting it to be anyways. The biggest complaint I have with this game is the complete lack of content. People say this is very sandbox. And honestly, it really isn't And I mean that truthfully. It is not sandbox. The only thing that makes this game come close to a sandbox is it's freedom of space and it's crafting system. And that's about all of the game's extra content. Kill animals, gather certain stuff from them to ""craft"" things that should have been there in the first place. It almost seems like they had the game planned out, but decided to cut a lot of stuff from it for you to get on you're own. Honestly if you are like me and was looking for a game to spend many many many hours on in it's open world doing things, you're better off buying something like Assassin's Creed or Just Cause 2, or GTA, or SOMETHING. This game was a dissopointment and I really shouldn't have gotten my hopes high for it. This game wants to be skyrim but lacks it's backbone in every aspect. BTW the multilayer is mediocre as hell and will drop your framerate faster than you can say ""oh",7,PC
"The Far Cry series is awesome, it's always been adventurous and always tried to be different from the normal games that were out at the time of their releases. But this one, I really can't say that, and that really brings it down. They tried to copy a CoD/Battlefield style of gunplay, and while it DID work well, it made the game a little less of it's own. They also got rid of a few things that brought me into the world of Far Cry 2 more than any other game. For one, the world was interactive, as if things could happen when you're not there. You could start brush fires that actually spread and burned lots of things. Now that's not to say this game has anything new, now the animals in the game attack AIs as if they were actual predators, where as before they did... nothing. Speaking of animals, I hated the way they used animal hides. I'm no schtickler, but I don't think making a wallet out of two different animal hides makes it hold any more. Well it's an okay game, and I would've put it at a 9/10 if it weren't in the Far Cry series.",7,PC
"I Think it's an interesting game, it is really cool the open world mote, it's just i don't really like the topic of Wild West, well, but in Wild West topic this was the best game i played, crafting and the open world is really cool, the graphics aren't bad at all, I enjoyed the story, the game has some surprises, anyway, the things is, i don't give 10 and 9 to Far Cry 3 because it's good, it is a good game, i didn't find any bugs or any bad things in the game even if i was searching, but the game has nothing good so i don't see a reason to give Far Cry 3 a 9 or 10.",7,PC
"Good characters, the story was pulled off well except for one decision that Jason makes that I didn’t buy at all. Being able to take out the outposts in any manner you please was great fun, but I think this is mainly because you could avoid the tedium of cover based combat. I didn’t finish the story line, the gameplay suffered greatly in the story based missions. Mostly it was Jason protecting another character with waves of pirates attacking you for some unspecified period of time. The other variant was for you to be charging through enemy lines waiting to come up against a wall of enemy fire you couldn’t tank and then we’re back to the same old cover based combat. During a story mission they attempted a stealth mission but it was just Jason following the path laid out for him by the developers. I didn’t finish this game, the gameplay just **** too hard during the story missions. 7/10 for the fun had with the outposts, characters and the story itself not the gameplay during the story.",7,PC
"Ok where to start. The gameplay here is awesome, as is the setting. Combine it with the free roam and you've got yourself one epic sandbox game, but there a couple glaring problems for me personally. The first one being the story. Now I loved Vaas and how the game starts, but honestly I couldn't hate Jason more. He goes from a giant baby to a giant @$$hole. Sure he's a survivor, but it doesn't mean he has to be a jerk as well. The stealth has some flaws (like enemies seeing you from 500 yards away through a bush), but it isn't a huge game breaking thing that happens often. What bothers me the most though is all the druggy crap and the perpetual swearing of every character in co-op. It really becomes unnecessary after a while and actually annoying. I know the villain is basically a drug dealer, but I don't want the entire game to be Jason getting high to get in touch all his spirits and stuff like that. Other than that though it really is a solid game.",7,PC
"Spent 60 on this due to all the glowing reviews about it. Skyrim with guns? Not even close. Pros for this game is the great story line, other than that it's almost borderline boring. Good guys wear blue, bad guys wear red, what they all shop at the same store for a team discount? animals are contained in specific areas, everyone says the same stuff over and over and the other npc's are usually mutes and can't speak at all. This game could have been a lot more, but it should never be compared to Skyrim as it's 1/10th of the same game.",7,PC
"Far Cry 3 many things right, but those are overshadowed by its many flaws. This game can be a lot of fun. The sandbox world provides hours of exploration. There are plenty of weapons and upgrades to spice things up, so players can use different tactics to dispatch baddies. I was pleasantly surprised by the lengthy main story. Its missions are segmented, so gamers can explore, tackle side quests, or wreak havoc once a mission is completed. Weapons and abilities upgrade rather quickly. This is a welcome reprieve since many sandbox games require a 40+ hour investment to max things out. My advice: Invest in health upgrades early on. Gunplay is decent. My loadout consisted of an LMG, shotgun, bow, and the Vector. The bow is easily my favorite weapon which is odd because I despise it in Crysis 3. Attaching grenades /molotovs to arrows converts the bow to a precision rocket launcher in seconds. At medium difficulty, the enemies are challenging enough and dish out some serious damage. Graphically the game impresses. Far Cry 3 uses the Dunia 2 engine, a heavily modified version of CryEngine. Fortunately for us, the game runs smoothly and is less glitchy than any Crytek game I’ve played. I find that ironic. Even with an older graphics card under the hood, I had no difficulty running the game on Ultra settings. Now for the bad. Foremost, all the NPC’s look the same. There might be 20 character models for the entire island. Every villager looks the same. Every baddie looks the same. Every old woman looks the same. And it gets worse. The NPC’s have a very, very limited number of lines. Within 30 minutes, you’ll hear everything that will be said on the island. And these same few lines will be repeated for 20+ hours or however long it takes to complete the game. Next, side quests are redundant. At any point in time, players will only be doing one of six things. In a nutshell, Far Cry 3 involves doing the same quests over and over again while killing hundreds of identical baddies who all say the exact same things. Sounds exciting, eh? Yeah, right… The narrative is a bit weak as it tries to force emotions on players that just aren’t there. Despite Far Cry’s gruesome opening, I didn’t feel the urgency to rescue a bunch of stupid rich kids who didn’t know they’re on an island filled with pirates. Despite my distaste for the protagonist and his friends, the story is good. Graphical comparisons are being made between Far Cry 3 and the original Crysis. I vote that Crysis looks better. Even on Ultra, there is still a fair amount of drawing on distant objects and texture quality is hit or miss on different surfaces. Colors are oversaturated much like the original Far Cry (that could be intentional) resulting in plastic looking foliage and props. Frankly, those things don’t really matter. But there is one glaring graphical fault in Far Cry 3: The character models. They’re just plain awful. I’m really baffled by how bad they look and move. As you can tell, I have a huge beef against the NPC’s in this game. Another gripe is the easy exploration. The game indicates locations of everything on the minimap AND players can purchase maps to reveal hidden items. So the “challenge” of exploration is gone. Simply travel to an area, look at your minimap, and get all the goodies. Wow! That was easy! Looting is problematic because prompts don’t always appear and the in game menu displays advertisements breaking the immersion. These issues aren’t game breaking, just incredibly annoying. The multiplayer is a mixed bag and a few steps above the tacked on garbage gamers got with Spec Ops: The Line. If you want to fight in shanty towns wearing t-shirts and sandals, pick up Max Payne 3. Gameplay is average—typical run and gun. The maps are larger than Black Ops 2 with plenty of places to hide, but they’re littered with shacks and debris. So expect an overabundance of close quarters combat. The online experience fares better in co-op mode. It has the potential to be really fun offering at least 10 hours of play in a single run. But players can’t choose which chapters to play, so many get stuck playing the same 2-3 chapters repeatedly. This glaring omission trashes the co-op mode which leads to my biggest complaints against the online experience: shoddy matchmaking and game breaking host migrations. To close, the sandbox experience of Far Cry 3 is truly great compared to most shooters. But too many of the campaign elements are bland and repetitive. The multiplayer has some strong elements, but execution is poor. Considering Ubisoft’s long history with online gaming, the sloppy multiplayer is inexcusable. A game is only as good as the sum of its part, and too many parts are under realized. If you don’t want to avoid a slapdash multiplayer and desire strong RPG elements, Skyrim is the best choice. But if you prefer guns to magic, Far Cry 3 is really the only alternative out right now.",7,PC
"I do kind of like this game, and I did enjoy playing it. However the game feels empty in a way. Everything feels like it is on easy mode. Cash and loot which can be sold for cash can easily be picked up on multiple enemies, meaning your hardly short of it. You can have access to every weapon pretty easily by going up and activating radio towers. This is probably the most time-consuming part of the game, afterwards its merely easy as everything is unlocked and missions are a breeze. Graphics and environment detail is great however a little behind modern times but who cares about graphics?. However many locations felt repetitive, there wasn't much difference with outposts and was merely boring once you completed a few of them. Gameplay was solid and particularly fun, everything you would want from a standard shooter. However every gun just felt similar and damage wise enemies were an easy kill and no match for me. Vehicles felt very loose when driving and I often found myself swerving off the road trying to turn a corner. Healing system was just pure easy mode, even without the medicine you could still regain most of your health meaning collecting green plants is more of less useless. Story is a bit shabby and is a bit of a cliche. The only real shame the game has is that it gets boring very quickly, I couldn't find myself playing this long hours at a time. After all the work getting everything is done, which is around 2 hours, you will find the game comes pretty repetitive quickly. Overall, it's a solid shooter and I would recommend trying it out regardless of its flaws and its repetitive gameplay.",6,PC
"Good trailer,good game but its still one more a weapon just weapon because the weapon store is too small dan far Cry 2 (no offence but its true)good story,good explore like skyrim but its not realy Realistic than Far Cry 2 you heal in far cry 3 is 3 bars its not deal in far cry 2 its just stabilize and with syrettes if character is Good on Far Cry 3 because that Jason Brody has guts to Kill ""Did i ever tell you the definition of insanity""(from Indonesia)",5,PC
"Highly overrated game. Major parts can only be called shallow, extremely repetive, boring and unchallenging. Gameplay is mostly following the same pattern all over again. Quest sends you to new region. You mark a radio tower on your map as target and simply go there to reveal the map of that surrounding region in detail. Those towers use to be unprotected so its really boring stuff to do. After that is done you usually mark a position of enemy camp as target, go there, few shots with your rifle to take out some pirates. Done. Also thanks to the incedibly broken ai again no challenge even on highest difficulty. What you are left with is a fully revealed, boring region with no enemies left, nothin much to do and like 100 crates scattered around the region waiting for you to get picked up to fill your pockets. Yes and that it is pretty much it. Graphics are decent, game is pretty much free of bugs and working fine, Vaas is fun. So i can not really call it horrible. Got it for 30 Euro in Steam sale, thats O.K.. Expected it to be overated and not worth a 87% metascore before buying it, so i did not get too disappointed.",7,PC
"The visuals look great and the island is amazing, but every NPC sounds like he's speaking in a cup, you quickly run out of fun stuff to do, and the main problem: Vaas. Warning, there are spoilers in here! After promoting the game for almost two years with Vaas literally making him the trademark of the game they just get rid of him in the first few hours. I lost my interest in the campaign right after Vaas' terribly executed death, and that's when the free roam problems occured. Weapons glitch, AI is stupid and sounds very off and the worst thing: you have a wallet that can reach a limit. I remember, after completing an Assassin's Creed game, I just kept collecting money, for the hell of it, but in Far Cry there is in fact a limit, wich drags the free roam fun down in an unseen way. I had high hopes, and those hopes only got statisfaction in the first few hours of story.",6,PC
"First of all, this is NOT the Skyrim of shooters or action games. This is a dolled up FPS that masks itself as an open-world sandbox game, but the only thing you can play with in that sandbox is a toy truck and a cat turd. The PC version is sleek and pretty, as well as mechanically smooth and visually-rewarding, but ultimately fails to be a top game. The story is inspired, but the whiny of a protagonist can't stop ""OMG""ing at every turn. Sometimes you wish he was the norm a silent puppet hero that so many games seem to be afraid to stray from. Quests seem bizarre and unnecessary. Am I seriously hunting sharks with a RPG right now? **** I **** I can craft a RUCKSACK. The AI is relatively unintelligible. This game was meant for YouTubers to make ""LOL moments"" videos with, but not much more beyond that.",5,PC
"In summary: fun to begin with, but a weak story, repetitive gameplay, weak AI, lack of challenge, very average multiplayer (too COD) and lack of replayability mean that for me this game is far from a classic. While this game improves on many of its predecessor’s flaws (eg, no more constantly respawning outposts), in my opinion it doesn’t live up to the hype and almost universal praise it has been receiving. For all its pretensions the storyline is pretty weak/clichéd and the characters very one dimensional, though very well acted. And it effectively hits a cul-de-sac when you reach the 2nd island. Jason is supposed to be a green, ordinary guy (as we are constantly reminded), but within half-an-hour he is proficient in a range of firearms, explosives, using a bow, stealth killing, making drugs, etc. It doesn’t work as a story. I thought the relationship between Jason and Vaas was interesting, but it wasn’t developed enough. And how many times can Vaas kill you without watching, only for you to escape? And the final confrontation with Vaas was a big anti-climax. I also found the “choose an ending” contrived and uninteresting. Yes it’s a truly open world shooter and the environments are well realised, yet there is little variation across the terrain. And while the graphics are mostly very good, the ambient occlusion looks horrible, some of the textures a little muddy and there is far too much use of blurring effects (especially the DOF). And I found a bit of variety in the quality of the sound effects. The gameplay is fun to begin with but quickly gets repetitive, and by the 2nd island I was bored. The many outposts are far too similar, the pirates/privateers not particularly intelligent and too unvaried, the story missions are uninspired and the game is too easy. I gave the multiplayer a few hours, but it’s fairly average and borrows heavily from COD without improving upon it.",6,PC
Absolutely love the gameplay and graphics!,7,PC
Just gome home bought this one and i am satisfied till now,6,PC
"Although i don't like modern shooters, this one was better but still not even close for old school shooters. Much better than far cry 2. Animals are fun, but herbage is bit boring in my honest opinion. Also too bright graphics, crysis 1 looks a bit more realistic. View from the cab does not exist too.",6,PC
"Pardon me, but this is half as good as it could be,. Great graphics, great enviroment but really poor variety of gameplay. To me is way worst than Far Cry 2, that at least has a better immersion and more challenging combats, making situations different any time. I mean that they are really similar but the predecessor gave me really more fun than this one. The story also is not deep as it could be.",6,PC
"The game ""itself"" is nice, nice graphics, nice shooting, nice combat system. The ""elimination"" that let´s u to 1hko the enemies is cool. Also the possibility to use stealth and sniping for silent attacks instead of crazy shooting makes the game enjoyable... So why a 6? well, cz the game is awesome... first 3-6 hours, depending on the time u recquire to understand the game just repeats itself once and again. The scenarios become quite familiar soon, cz in the end 90% of it is just random jungle. Missions and sidequest repeats themselves once and again, as said. So is fun for some shooting, but unless u´re qutie good at repeating the same tasks and re-play the same things over and over again, u may find urself tired of it. So conclusion: is a good game, but u may feel tired and/or annoyed soon.",6,PC
"Unlike many of my friends, I enjoyed Far Cry 2. What a brilliant shift from the first game into an environment we hardly see in gaming in Africa. Now, yes I am aware that I am reviewing Far Cry 3. I just want you the reader to be aware of my experience with Far Cry 2 first. FC3 however, unlike FC2 was a disappointment to me. Yes the world looks fantastic and the return to the island jungle is a welcome one. But FC3 was just too dull for me. It felt exactly like FC2 only with a brighter sun and surf on my doorstep. Oh an not having malaria this time is always a delight in gaming. The story is interesting, Vas is crazy and I must save my moron friends. That works fine in this island paradise. But while on this journey of the mind and sole of my character I grew to, well, there is no easy way to say this hate myself. Not in reality, but within the game. Why, you may ask? Simple, unlike Gordon Freeman, he speaks and what he has to say is of no value and often takes the words out of my mouth before I get to say anything in reality. This happens when I enter a cave or put out an arm fire. He just chimes in and says the obvious. Things like ""wow, what a cave amazing place"". Yes Jason, we get it. Me aside, the game world offers very little as far as open world games go. Radio tower scouts, hunting, driving to kill people, you name it. All those dull things just didn't carry any real value to me other than building bigger wallets to buy slightly better weapons once in a while. The camera is also useless as I found I couldn't bring it out to take wonderful screenshots of this oceanic paradise. Why not?! I did enjoy taking over locations. This is something that the game developers have done with such a simple fineness that makes them enjoyable. The main story is not too bad either and worth a good play-through at least once. But if I play through it again, the game would need to be patched to remove any dialogue from my character, he is just so full of um... Solid game, but not as good as it could be. 7/10.",7,PC
"FC3 would be rather nice game without sandbox. The story parts of the game are good indeed, but the sandboxing and hunting animals to get better quiver etc. is just stupid. Furthermore, the whole crafting system is way too shallow. It is as if the character carries a laboratory, workbench and leather tanning/boiling equipment with him all the time. There are still lessons to learn where FC2 failed. Better luck next time.",6,PC
"This game had quite a lot of promise, but unfortunately I feel it makes the same mistakes many other sandbox RPG's make, namely the lack of serious content. The worst thing about this game, which, in our modern era of gaming we should be far beyond, and that is the repetitive filler side quests. No thought seems to have been put into them at all. Far cry is the first game I've ever actually given up finishing the side content because after the first 5 minutes of it I've already experienced the rest of the side content. The story line is a bit unbelievable but bearable, except for the strange endings. I would prefer the game over similar titles like assassins creed 3 (which far cry 3 has appropriated many many features from), the crafting system is a little bit tedious. While far cry was a fun experience, it certainly isn't anything unique, i don't see the appeal that the critics saw in this game, seems to be more of the same in my eyes.",5,PC
"To sum it up quickly, Far Cry 3 is a good game. Not superb, not ground-breaking, and sometimes annoying, but overall it's good. A lot of the annoyances of Far Cry 2 have been put to bed (the appalling re-spawning springs to mind), and Far Cry 3 offers a nice tropical atmosphere, a decent story, and a good world to explore. Criticisms? Well the saving system is poor (checkpoints in an open world? C'mon!), the animal hunting quickly becomes irrelevant once you've crafted your equipment, and the AI is pretty stupid at times. Also, the missions (outside the main story line) are pretty lame. It's either ""hunt an animal"" or ""kill someone with a knife"" and that's about it. Let me be clear, ""Skyrim with guns"" it most certainly isn't (Skyrim has far more depth). Still, it's a fun shooter overall. Only problem is imagine how good it could have been with decent side quests, a slightly better inventory and a proper saving system. Now THAT would have been Skyrim with guns...",7,PC
"I bought this because I was misleaded to believe that this game was skyrim with guns, I love skyrim and to compare Far cry 3 to Skyrim is an insult to bethesda and skyrim fans, this game has absolutely nothing to dowith skyrim except that is open world and you hunt that's about it, you cant craft something you can sell like in skyrim, you can't wear different outfits like in skyrim, bad guys always look and act the same, in skyrim bad guys have different armours different weapons etc etc etc. Don't get me wrong Far cry 3 is an entertaining gane for a few hours but it gets extremely boring after that, oh and it looks like sh@#t in Xbox, I recommend you to wait for it to be on sale in steam and go for it",5,PC
"Far Cry 3 saved the series after a string of pointless spin-offs of the first game, a remake, and a remake OF the remake. To top it off, the last main entry, Far Cry 2, was a mediocre, frustrating, redundant, and unrewarding game set in a somewhat-interesting landscape that lacked any incentive to explore it. Far Cry 3 was a welcome improvement over its predecessors, However, the game still suffers from the biggest game-breaking flaw that has plagued the series since the beginning: A large, beautiful environment with no rewards for actually exploring it. All of the weapons are available to the player for free, as long as they unlock radio towers, and the process of doing so requires no challenge. To make it worse, the player has unlimited, free access to previously-unavailable weapons after they pick them up from the corpse of a foe. Meaning if you just grabbed a shiny new gun from the ground, congratulations, you now have it an endless free supply of them, just like any other weapon you may have shelled out thousands of dollars for. There are hardly any unique side-quests worth going out of your way for, and they only reward you with money, which you'll find you have plenty of mid-way through the game. Money is almost worthless once you have all of the weapons readily available. The only purpose is buying the occasional much-needed health, ammo, or body armor. None of which (with maybe the exception of body armor) are difficult to obtain on your own. In fact, I have so many green leaves, which are use to craft healing items, that I had to sell most of them just because I needed the space, and I would never, ever need that much. There are other types of syringes, used for such things as boosting damage resistance to fire, and aiding your hunting and exploration abilities, however, they are unnecessary. Hunting isn't particularly difficult, and neither is combat, even on the most difficult setting. I could go on and on about why Far Cry 3 will not satisfy those who want a meaningful sandbox game, but if you are looking for a slick, fulfilling shooter game, you'll have a blast. Good controls is vital to great combat. Far Cry 3 rivals Max Payne 3 for having the most crisp, fluid controls of any PC game of 2012, even on mid-grade gaming rigs that can't quite run Far Cry 3 with optimal performance. The graphics are eye-popping; the water stands out. The many lakes, rivers, and waterfalls look incredible, especially when the sunlight shimmers along the top, and the bodies of your enemies float freely, slowly staining the teal-liquid red. In short ,Far Cry 3 fails to impress the adventurer in me, but the warrior in me hasn't been this impressed with a shooter since BioShock.",7,PC
"As far as the single player portion of the game is concerned, this is the undoubtedly the best Far Cry ever. But in terms of multiplayer... I'm feeling pretty disappointed here. I'm sure other user reviews have already pointed this out, but it's something the developer needs to be called out on. They removed vehicles from multiplayer. I just don't understand. The whole ""wow factor"" of Far Cry multiplayer has always been the huge open levels with vehicles. I feel betrayed to be honest. But what do they care, they already got my money. I would have given this game a 10 if they didn't remove such a heavy feature from the previous games.",5,PC
"This is a very average game. It definitely does not deserve the ratings it was given (especially being called 'Skyrim with guns'. The scenery is very beautiful, booming with biodiversity and luscious colors. The player action mechanics could have been polished a lot more, often I struggle to enter vehicles, door ways, and turrets. Its an open world, but the majority of it is not worth exploring. Your not going to be aimlessly walking around in hopes to find a secret area which will hold some awesome side quest, but instead you will be mostly likely driving/gliding/boating/fast travelling to your next main quest objective. Side quests are a joke as they are repeats of other challenges (hunt this animal, race to his area, kill this one guy in an enemy base). The main quests are the only thing you will want to be doing unless you are killing animals to upgrade your ammo pouches/syringe kits so you can survive the main quests. The main quests were fun in the beginning with the diversity in the formula (car chases, burning down pot fields, tripping on drugs), but after the first half of the game the formula seemed to narrow down to silently killing everything in a base, or fight waves of enemies until your ride gets you out. There's only two types of loot: leafs to make syringes, and things to sell for money (and I mean you literally have to sell them because they serve no other purpose). There is also collecting furs and skins to upgrade your pouches, but upgrading them to the necessary amount to survive the whole game can be done easily before continuing to the second mission. The story line was interesting and realistic for the most part, except for the tattoos, but I also liked that too (this part is all opinion based). The theme which is 'state of society to state of nature' I also liked as it was a new twist from most games. The leveling system was average. It can be best related to a borderlands skill tree. Many main characters often become a thing of the past as you advance through the game. TL;DR: the game is alright, has a lot of potential, but lacks a lot of diversity and does not deserve anywhere close to the ratings and hype they gave for it.",7,PC
"The single player was exciting and superbly entertaining. I enjoyed beautiful island with all its wildlife and madmen. The greatest downside was the multiplayer. NO DEDICATED SERVERS?? How can a PC multiplayer work without dedicated servers? The game stops and sometimes disconnects when the host leaves, it really gets on my nerves and I did not get the multiplayer experience I had hoped for.",7,PC
"1st part of the game was incredible. But after moving to 2nd island the game experience dropped increasingly. Looks like developers was exhausted all ideas they introduced in first part of the game. The difficulty level increases too much for me, its became irritating - despite I was playing on hard on 1st island I cannot handle easy mode on 2nd (maybe I was tired of the game). It seems it is the way to make game longer. 2nd part focuses only of shooting - nothing more. The idea of exploration on the 2nd island was dig. So the first island I judge for 9, but the 2nd island for 5 only.",7,PC
"First 10 minutes of Farcry 3 starts brilliantly. The escape from Vass's camp was well done and the character of Vass himself was enjoyable. But then it goes down hill after you get a magic tattoo. There is no challenge in this game what so ever. Even on the ""hardest difficulty"" it is hilariously easy. The AI is quite simply broken and spend most of the game killing each other or from wildlife to be an actual threat.. The story is pathetic badly written and a lot of the time makes no sense. Graphics are great but can not make up for the simplified gameplay. The crafting system is a joke, you only need on type of leaf to craft any syringe, not that it matters as I never used the combat/hunting stims as there is no point. The skill system did not need to be in the game at all, seriously how many ways of stabbing an enemy do I need after I get the bow? Not being able to turn off item glow or the items showing in your map is annoying forced hand holding crap that I would expect if I was playing on easy. Missions are often tedious and boring and ""boss fights"" are nothing more than badly done quick time events. If you have not bought this yet, either pirate it or wait for it to be around the 20$ mark. It had huge potential and had some good ideas, memorable characters and the jungle is very attractive but the lack of challenging gameplay or sensible storyline makes the game fall flat on its face. Sad to see something that could of been brilliant had most of its fun points such as survival and stealth made useless or overpowered. Enemies have to be looking directly at you to see you, even then you have time to move into some bushes. Probably my biggest buyers remorse of the past 6 months.",5,PC
"The game is great, but the constant framerate drops when NOTHING IS HAPPENING ONSCREEN is annoying as all hell. I know i have the recommended requirements because a lot of times where lots of things are happening. i still can run the game at 40-50 fps.",5,PC
"As a fan of the Far Cry franchise, I really wanted to like this game, but I found it remarkably difficult to enjoy. It has a few interesting concepts (hunting, takedowns, zip lines) but they are poorly implemented and do little to make this game fun. They have eliminated many of the major flaws found in Far Cry 2 (e.g. infinitely respawning guards), but also many of the things which made that game enjoyable (e.g. 'buddies' and weapon deterioration). Many of the new features and mechanics feel like they were borrowed from the Assassin's Creed franchise (e.g. looting bodies, climbing towers to reveal the map). The story is much more developed in this game than its predecessor, but unfortunately it is also less interesting overall. Throughout the story you are forced to endure many dream or hallucination sequences that are generally boring and do nothing to advance the story. Even the major 'boss fights' are ruined in this way, forcing you to endure quick-time events or repetitive corridor shooting, rather than allowing you to just play the FPS game you wanted. Probably the worst part is that although this game is technically 'open world,' the world feels very empty and boring. There's plenty of lush terrain to explore but precious few things to do there: the handful of enemy bases are easily captured (permanently), which also removes all enemy patrols from the area, and the few civilian settlements have almost nothing to do there, and you cannot talk to hardly any civilian NPCs. Overall it's not a terrible game, but I did find it to be a big let-down, and it certainly does not live up to the hype surrounding it.",6,PC
"I loved the sense of weight and inertia that is conveyed in first person in Far Cry 3. It feels very similar to battlefield 3 in the physicality of your character. And so I had a great impression of this game in the first 5 hours, and might have given it a 10. Unfortunately, the missions that follow the main plot line fall into a rote, scripted manner, and most of the time put a blaring timer on top of the screen, breaking all the amazing illusions created by the game world. One thing people may gloss over - the writing and characters are, at times, offensively bad. I think I speak for many when I say that overused stereotypes of the ""white man saving the indigenous people"" trope is obvious and tired. And seriously, **** Vaas. Try harder Ubisoft, seriously. (Quoting Alice in Wonderland throughout was another misguided creative attempt, I felt.) There is a lack of creativity with the entire setting and modern day milieu, and it doesn't interfere entirely with main feel of the game, but it does stifle what could have been. Still definitely worth playing.",7,PC
Most over rated game of 2012. The story is by far the best part of this game no doubt. Vas is what makes this game I mean the dude is on the cover. Lets face it though once you finish him off there is nothing left to do. You grind through a story that has become less interesting although not yet bad. And once you take the forts on the island there is nothing left to do. The game gives a good 20 hours tops of gameplay and the multiplayer is well done. However the game itself is empty and the plot is filled with holes and cliche copy paste story lines from movies.,6,PC
The devs did a great job on this one,6,PC
"After 14 hours of gameplay i have to say that this is the most over hyped game of the year 2012. At first it may seem that there are lots of things you can do in the game but in the end its just collecting materials to weapon slots, ammunition pouches etc. When you actually manage to get all upgrades to your items hunting loses its purpose completely. Enemy AI is ridiculous and they often make themselves visible out in the open fields and like that. I feel FarCry3 could have been done way better but now it just stays as mediocre FPS game.",6,PC
"The best part of far cry 3 is the singleplayer. The island is huge and pretty. The wildlife is done great and the ""survival"" aspects of the game is great fun. There is a lot quests to keep you busy but the quests that is not part of the main campaign is not very varied and will therefor get quite repetitive pretty fast. You can however for the most time decide how you approach your goal which is a nice feature. The main campaign of the game is surprisingly varied and the story have a lot of good moments and memorable characters. The story do however also have some weak spots with some really silly plot turns. The gunplay and action isn't the best that i have seen but that do not have a huge impact on the game since the gameplay is as varied as it is. The singleplayer do however have some minor problems. Radiotowers and enemey bases get old really fast. terrible boss-battles, quicktime events, strange enemy back-up and annoying heavy soldiers is a couple of examples. The multiplayer part of the game is alright. The co-op is a lot more actions oriented than the singleplayer which kind of **** since that wasn't the best part of the game. The normal multiplayer is bland but ok. I would say that the game is overall quite impressive and that the singleplayer is enough for me to recommend this game to everyone with an interest in the genre.",7,PC

"I have very mixed feelings about this game. Yes its a great shooter with excellent mechanics, interesting scenarios, a very rich and well developed world, there's really no game engine or mechanics related complaints from me. I think that the story, while easy to criticize, was fairly non intrusive and provided some guidance to the progression of the game; this is not an rpg, don't expect an rpg. However at the end of this game, I felt absolutely nothing but disappointed. For a game world of this magnitude, you end up going through only a tiny fraction of it and very seldom in any sort of truly engaging way. There are very few moments of immersion or tension, very few moments of excitement; don't get me wrong, when the **** hits the fan in this game it becomes very entertaining and surprising, but the problem is that this just doesn't happen often enough. 80% of the game is spent doing little rpg-element activities or simply travelling... the real guilty parties here are not any of the programmers but rather the directors and designers who just didn't make even remotely adequate use of what their development team handed to them. To give you an example; as part of the huge map, there are WWII era bunker installations all over the place, moldy and ruined and full of atmosphere; and the best way that the designers could come up with to make use of these is to put ""letters"" in them and tell the player to look for the letters and read them... seriously. That's just a tragic loss of potential and its one of many.",6,PC
"For me this is game of the year for sure. After disappointing games like Diablo 3 and Mass Effect 3 i did not expected much from Far Cry 3. The bigger surprise was when i started playing this game. Really great sand box experience with great combat system and many side quests. Single player got also really interesting story with great characters and pretty good endings (both of em). And that´s not all, there is also a multiplayer with Co-op.",7,PC
"If you have to view Far Cry 3 critically, it's biggest fault is the main character and the fact that the story just isn't very good. It's a decent game though, but things never seem to come together. Not to mention, FC3 has some of the worst boss battles in games to date. My verdict: A flawed and highly overrated shooter, with moments of sheer brilliance. This is the pinnacle of average gaming",6,PC
"Good graphics, sounds and excellent visuals. The story and the settings is innovative, even though the storyline itself is quite weak. To make a long story short: This is a GREAT improvement since FC2. However the game is slighly poorly optimized and there is lack of graphic settings for the PC version to make it even higher. Unfortunately, the game suffers when Singleplayer is done. The MP menu's is a mess and seems to be directly ported from the console version. There is no dedicated servers so you'll have to waitin a lobby and experience more unstable gameplay. Multiplayer is also far to dumbed down with features such as enemies on the minimap, killcam, and xray-vision - even though you CAN deactivate all this to your own preference, doing so will ironically, make you end up playing -UNRANKED-, which mean that you cannot gain any XP - at all. All in all, FC3 is by far the best game in the series, but unfortunately its shortcoming makes the experience drop for me and it does not feel like it gives the PC a fair piece of the cake.",6,PC
"I'm not gonna lie. Far Cry 3 was probably the most fun I've had with any releases of this year so far. But that's mainly because there wasn't that much else that quite reached it's level in terms of both content and execution. But does that really make it a good game? ****. It is good, however people now a days seem to make out everything that is above mediocre to be the greatest thing ever, which it really isn't. I'd say one of it's biggest problems is that it's just all in all not really challenging. I played the game on the hardest difficulty level and even then the enemies aren't much of a thread, especially once you upgrade your health. The healing mechanic is also just broken. You can heal yourself whenever you want and how many times you want, even during combat.. Not to mention that there's also healing syringes that heal you even faster. The game's also rather grindy. I like the fact that you have to hunt animals to craft new pouches etc, but it would have been more enjoyable if you'd start hunting naturally and not having to go to specific places to find a specific animal in order to craft or upgrade something. Far Cry 3 also suffers from what I like to call ""Overkill syndrome"". Meaning that the beginning is actually the most challenging part of the game, but as you unlock more things, the game becomes progressively easier. So it's exactly the opposite of how a game should progress. The world it self is pretty empty. The only main attractions are liberating outposts and some side quests that rarely differ. (Kill that guy with a knife, hunt down that animal with a bow). Honestly, liberating the outposts is pretty much the best part of the game because it's just simply the most sandbox-y. I was also rather disappointed by the story. It's so well acted! Vaas (the guy on the cover) is such a great **** he only gets like 5 minutes of **** he's only there for like half of the game. I think the main problem here is that the characters are just so weakly established. I really didn't care for most of them, even though they had such great performances. The ending's also pretty weak. It just pulls a ""Choose your ending cutscene"" kind of ending. The multiplayer and CO-OP aren't really noteworthy either. CO-OP is just tagged on mission based **** No exploration, just stand inside of a base and kill incoming enemies. As for the competitive Multiplayer, I certainly had more fun with that than co-op, but I don't see it lasting for very long. Though I really liked how they took familiar game modes and put some new mechanics into them. They even added in a new game mode called firestorm which is certainly worth checking out. However it suffers from what most multiplayer components suffer from now a days. Having to level up and unlock new gear is tedious and really senseless in a game like this. You can't level up in custom and private matches. And the biggest killer: Match-making only. Why? Because it never **** works. I rarely get into a game that doesn't have at least 2 host immigrations. The map editor is certainly a lot of fun to mess around with. However nobody really plays on custom maps because as stated: No leveling in custom matches. All in all if someone asked me if they should buy the game at full price...sure, go ahead. There's certainly a lot of fun to be had. It's just not as perfect as most people make it out to be. if you're only interested in single player anyway, I'd say wait for the price to drop.",6,PC
"Very bland but fun for a while... Cons... While the game is fun it adds nothing new. It looks 3/4 years old and just shows how the current gen of consoles are holding back gaming. The voice acting is total ass, you're on an island near China but the locals have South African accents while the bad guys have mid Africans accents. You play as an American teen/20s showing the island how badass you are. The crafting is dull in that you just need easy to gain animal skins or plants, half the **** you can craft you don't actually need, for example, health stims... You can heal for free by pulling out bullets in your arm or **** a bandage. Stims?... The game is easy enough that you don't even need them. Hunting is boring... The only animals that hold any sort of challange are bears and tigers and that is because head shots don't instant kill so you can just lob a grenade at them, failing that just run at them with a shotgun. The story is rather meh. As I said, you play a badass American kid trying to save his buddies. Yawn. Pros... It's open world.",5,PC
"Not too shabby. Good graphics and lots to do, though I find I cannot play for more than a couple hours at a time without getting frustrated or losing interest. There are badguys everywhere all the time and while I have specific goals I want to accomplish, I always end up engaged in firefights and running out of ammo before I can even get to them. The open world 1 player is pretty cool, but the co-op is too linear. There's not enough stuff or slots to carry it in (unless you go farm local fauna/flora.) You get killed after taking 3 or four bullets and restoring health is a sloppy pain. I also find I am running out of ammo too much- there needs to be more arrows laying around. The Hud/minimap and menu controls are just plain clumsy. I think I've been spoiled too much by Borderlands2. If I didn't need to listen for enemies, I would play the game listening to mp3s -the in-vehicle radio play lists are highly annoying. Also, I appreciate the value of a well-placed f-bomb, but the swearing is a little over the top and into the realm of ridiculousness like some potty-mouthed 7th graders wrote the script. With a little more polish, this title could shine instead of glowing moderately.",6,PC
"Far Cry 3 is an average game at best for me, It claim it have open world element like Skyrim, which it does however it's still pretty linear best. I will make a lot of comparison with Skyrim since they both pretty similar. If you like me, you will like to sneak, explore, craft, kill, leveling up and story line. The sneaking in Far Cry 3 in my honest opinion is excellent, it's almost the same as Skyrim but maybe easier since whenever someone somewhat looking for you, the indicator will tell you the direction he/she coming from. This makes the game incredibly easier and since the sneak kill reward you more experience with knife kills, it prob the better patch choice but be warn, it will make the game easier. I pretty much cover sneak, kill and leveling up at this point, you can go blazing your way down with guns and rocket launcher but you wont get as much experience that way. The weapons in this game you can achieve easily by controlling them radio tower or purchasing them, if they can put crafting recipe to make AK that will be awesome. One experience that satisfying however when i put land mine and throw stones next to it so enemy can get blown up. Exploration and crafting probably one of the most important aspect in a open world game. I'm not a fan of collecting all collectibles or achievement in game or steam, I think of them as a gimmick that developer put to make the game more ""interesting"" or rich of ""content"", no offense to you guys who likes to do them. The game related exploration however is pretty dull, you can kill certain animals to get their hides or flowers to get their petals(I'm assuming) and craft them to make more extra pouch/bigger wallet, etc. This is a good idea however, after i played for an hour, i realized, i didn't even need them as i took the assassin route. You can use your ""First-Aid"" and upgrade them like you would do with your other skills thus making herbs/drugs pointless. The same goes with crafting pouches or wallet, if you stealth like person otherwise you do need to go out and hunt some hides to carry more stuffs. The story in the game have to be good for me to keep me interested, I kid you not, i play CoD MW just for the story, putting that aside, i think the story is dull, the main character is prob the most annoying character in this game, he whine about cannot use gun etc at first then when he actually use it, he is a pro at it(depends on your skill of course). I find that annoying to listen to him and the way he act like Rambo in the end is laughable. There are other main characters that need your help, including the so call army called ""rakyat"" rakyat is people in Indonesian by the way, how do i know that? cause i am Indonesian. Overall, the story just not interesting enough for me to keep me interested, I just wanted to rush over and finish the game. In conclusion, the game is ok but very limited content if you don't care about achievements/collectibles, game is easy enough as is, especially early game with stealth path, crafting drugs seems pointless and the character is just not interesting enough. In my opinion, this game not worth the full retail price, maybe wait for steam sale to get it.",5,PC
"Well I enjoyed the game at some points but it was extreme buggy, even on my Gtx 2gb Nvidia card which should be above average, and my 8gb ram. I had constantly some bugs on the visual effects like smoke and explosions. The boss battles just ****, there is no clear thing that you kill a guy or a horde of his guys and then kill him, all boss fights happen like in a vision where you see daemons and crap. Well was nothing special. The graphics **** compared to Crysis of course.",5,PC
"It shouldn't come as a surprise, what with all the media coverage and the sellouts of the gaming industry claiming ""enlightening gameplay"" that this game is mediocre at best. I've played FC2 a lot and i see no major differences between FC3 and FC2. I mean sure, FC3 graphically stunning, colorful and it has something resembling a story, as opposed to FC2, but all those things aside it suffers from lack of ideas in more areas than one. The setting is a large and spacious rainforest/jungle with no apparent limits to movement. Sadly, this world is populated by stupid NPCs and wild animals and has practically NO variety to gameplay. The missions are pathetically simple and stupid (Kill this, kill that, go there, come back). One of the things, that this game has going for it, is the crafting system. It's a refreshment, however small, and it appeals to most of the gamers that feel betrayed by the aforementioned lack of content. The RPG elements feel a tad out of place, but find their purpose nonetheless. With those elements there's also the illusion of ""progress"" that plagues every game of late, but it's transparently obvious that it's a lie. I mean you're shooting guns at people from a distance and then they die. Not as often, they shoot back and then you die. It all comes down to how good you are at aiming and not dying, just like any other FPS, and that is OK. The story is cliche. People get kidnapped and it's up to you to get them back. I don't know about anyone else, but i'm getting tired of that shtick. The characters are reminiscent of those in FC2, and the voice acting can be tedious, but is ultimately satisfying. All in All, it's a good FPS for people that want freedom of movement, mindless action and colorful backgrounds, but even they will be bored after a while and go for something more fulfilling.",5,PC
"FC3 is along with AC3 the biggest dissappointment in 2012 / 2013, what bothered me the most is that there is no enemy artificical intelligence at all it seems, all the missions must be played exactly as the level designer made it there is nothing individual, if you dont do things exactly as ubi wants you to do it, the mission failes, i recall that even FC2 or FC1 had a better Enemy AI, and Level Design, so FC3 looks like a downgrade to me. Sure the GFX are nice, but its no destructable environment like Crysis / BF3 has, so half of the nice GFX arent worth it to begin with. Also the looting, the treasures, the relics, and memory cards are brainless collections, Seems like Ubisoft is gameversions v.3 are worst the gaming world ever seen. So as summary, when you can get the game on some sale for 10 - 20 dollars its worth spending it, anything above is a waste of your / my money, cause the overall gameplay of FC3 is more compareable to some Commodore 64 / Atari games what we had like 20 years ago.",7,PC
"I have to admit, the intro and beginning blew me away. The game was pretty, the cinematics were great and the game felt free and fun BUT after 10-15 hours later i find the game virtually boring and unplayable WHY? It's downright repetitive and enemies and wildlife spawn randomly, so the triumph of clearing an area is not there as they will just respawn with time. Crafting was cool at first, but all you really need is some baggage and then you are done with it. Loot boxes are scattered randomly over the map, but loot is not worth much as you acquire guns for free as you progress anyway. Vehicles are all over the place, etc etc. Basically everything is just randomly positioned around and it's the same wherever you go. The missions are completely boring. The best thing about the game is the cutscenes and character models.",6,PC
"The game is becomes boring very fast. Before you know it, all you do is clear pirate bases and activate communication towers. The only interesting parts are the main plot missions but those won't last that long. There is no motivation to explore, as you never get anything besides money (presuming you manage not to run around with a full wallet) and junk. You don't get anything like special weapons or interesting items. The requirement to craft bags and stuff, makes it pretty tedious. You don't need medicine at all, as they're just bonus buffs and it's not like you need health pots as you can always just duck around a corner and heal with your basic heal instead of instantly with a health pot, this is a FPS not Diablo. The regular enemies and allies are just clones of eachother. They literally have like a couple face variants being repeated over and over and they're all just regular humans. Anyway, game is boring and bland.",7,PC
"I played this game for 2/3 days, just running and shooting and base-jumping. I like the story and graphics. It's one big awesome action movie adventure. The game play is also very good for a shooter. I do think it is a shame that they made this game so easy. I play every game on the hardest settings, because the game will last longer and gives you all it has got. Even though I played it on the hardest difficulty, it was too easy. Another thing I do not like it that the game stops and gives you nothing to shoot any more. I completed all the assignments and then the game is just a big world with good guys.. so you start killing the good guys after a while. After all: It is worth you money, it is worth your time and when I upgrade my computer, the game will be even more awesome, because the graphics are absolutely gorgeous.",7,PC
"Well, I loved Far Cry 1 and enjoyed Far Cry 2. I found Far Cry 3 to be a mixed bag. I agree with many of the comments that think Far Cry is trying to be COD & Uncharted (staged scenes and interactive style quick time really ****!). Then you add the glowing items on the map and you feel that your hand is being held walking through the game. On the PC the menu's are inconsistent in function and for some reason things like the the scroll wheel only work on certain menus. The driving is horrible and like being on ice depending upon the vehicle. On the positive the shooting is tight, the bow is a blast and hard to master unless you use the red dot attachment. The overall voice acting is good, but Jason can get annoying. You also don't have any alternative actions on the main quest (there will be times where you just think if I did this now - it would be done - instead you get to go off on side quests to get back to where you were). Overall the game is OK, but the series is definitely going in the wrong direction (mass market)! Fortunately I got this game free with my new 7970 (the saving grace).",5,PC
"This game has so much potential... but its dragged down by so much unecessary crap. Gather quests? Really? Am I playing Farcry, or WoW? Climb these radio towers to open your map... Guess someone was playing Assassin's Creed at the time they came up with that idea? In trying to fix the broken stealth from FC2, they made it so easy there is no challenge. Enemy's are incredibly stupid. The body drag mechanic could use some work, really, I can't pick up and drag a body from the ground, only after I kill them with a take down? Weapons... 1 attachment... wonder what kind of red dot they are using that blocks out extended mags. It could have been such a good game... but it turned out just to be mediocre. It just feels like there's something missing.... it's a hollow and shallow experience. That being said, it's not the worst game ever either.",5,PC
"After finishing the game I can say, it was enough entertaining to keep me playing but I cant say I was enjoying it. Sometimes it was extremely frustrating, especially when trying to capture outposts through stealth and godlike sight of guards, who spotted me in bushes, 200 yards far in the middle of the night even though I was using bow or silenced rifle. What I want to say during the game I have experienced few wonderful (few hunting quests, shooting and combat dynamics,..) but plethora of dull, boring, repetitive or annoying moments. Technically the game is also very ambivalent, on one hand you will see beautiful sceneries of an almost photorealistic quality, few yards away you ll hit a disgusting texture of ps1 era. I think this game needed few months of polishing and complete redesign of stealth mechanics and quests. Also change of environment wouldnt harm. During the game I was remembering almost 3 years old Just Cause 2 which looks much more stunning due to its environment complexity (deserts, snow, jungle, cities,...). In Far Cry 3 you have only jungle... In my opinion eurogamer review couldnt be more wrong this time..",6,PC
"The story line reminds me of a low-budget teen film that is not all that interesting, and makes little sense. You play Jason who seems ready to crack under pressure at the slightest hint of a stressful situation, doesn't seem to know really anything, but is somehow transformed into a bad ass, tattoo-wearing warrior that knows his way around a gun and has developed ninja-assassin skills almost over night. Voice acting is good though, except for Jason. They didn't need to have him yelling, ""I'm coming Lisa!"" while trying to sneak up on enemies. It's an open world, so go where you want (mostly). You can go off on side missions, though they are not very fun. The Trials of Rakyat are the best, which have you doing missions on a timer. All missions earn you money and XP. XP gets you skill unlocks, but don't worry about which skills to get, because eventually, if you complete a bunch of side missions, you'll get them all anyway. The three main side missions: Medical supply drops have you race against a timer. Wanted Dead force you into using stealth to kill a pirate holding out somewhere. Hunting has you tracking down animals. The main purpose of hunting is for crafting larger stuff so you can carry more weapons, ammo, grenades, and money. Most people will want to craft the upgrades right away, so get ready for a few hours of boring hunting, because it **** running low on ammo, having no room in your sack, or only being able to carry one gun. The stuff you do pick up is pretty much pointless, and is only worth selling off so you can buy stuff for your weapons. But you don't even have to really buy weapons, because the game practically gives them to you free. All you have to do is climb some radio towers that are pretty much left unguarded by the enemy, and easy to climb (this also reveals more of the map). You can take over outposts to make regions safer for you, and less likely to run into enemies. However, this makes it boring in the long run because the enemies never try to take it back, and then the only thing you have to be wary of are the tons of animals that want to constantly eat you, and they can take a full magazine of bullets to the head before dying. Fortunately, you can choose how you want to take an outpost, and it can be a blast; use stealth, go in guns blazing, or blow the heck out of the place-- doing anything but stealth will result in an alarm going off and more enemies showing up that you can kill. It's also kind of cool that they made it so that things actually catch fire, though nothing really gets destroyed. As far as enemies go, they are kind of dumb (but not so dumb that they just run at you). The stuff they say is laughable at first, but after hearing a pirate say the same line for the 100th time about it hurting when he pees, it gets tiresome. They do at least run for cover, but often times that cover is right next to you and all you do is step around the corner and blow them away. Which is easy since you can see the enemy through walls. Yes, that right: if you spot an enemy (especially through your camera or scope) you gain x-ray vision, apparently. As far as graphics go, I think they look great on my rig, playing it in 1080p, setting the FOV higher than the default, and everything turned on high with AA on. What really brings this game down is the repetitiveness of most missions (which are generally very easy to complete), a horrible HUD that constantly pops up messages (supposedly a fix is on the way for that), how EASY it is to beat on normal, and some of the worst bugs I've ever seen in a game on release day. One of the most annoying bugs is a glitch in which a grenade, a Molotov, or other object gets stuck to your characters right arm, and it gets in the way when **** my case it is a grenade. I have also had a glitch where I see the enemy vibrating oddly, or a mission marker not going away after I've completed the mission. Some friends of mine told me they can't progress because **** bug they have ran into. Three patches have been released, the first couple attempted to fix some crashing issues, but the last one highlighted a fix for 32 core systems (who is playing this on a 32-core **** I'm not even sure the game-breaking bugs are going to be addressed. To sum things up: Far Cry 3 is a fun, but a very easy game to beat, that has some very annoying, and game-breaking bugs, and some boring elements to it. At this point, it is a gamble if you are thinking of buying it. Personally, I haven't had one crash or bug that broke my game-- mostly just annoyances. I haven't tried MP, but I bought this mainly for SP mode. I hear MP is trash anyway. I'm hoping a future patch will remove that grenade attached to my wrist, but I won't hold my breath. If I finish the game before then, it will probably sit and collect digital dust in my Steam library with some of the other subpar games I bought this year",6,PC
"I was not impressed by the latest Farcry release. When I first began the game it immediately reminded me of Just Cause 2. Both open world FPS games which drop you in a beautiful island in dire straights. Farcry 3 carries a more of a survival theme however and starts off catchy with a easy to follow cliche plot. When the intro is over and the world opens up to you things become dull and repetitive. Every animal on the island becomes your next handbag in the pursuit of latching infinitely more weapons to your person. You will literally feel compelled to kill everything you see other than your homies who wear different colored shirts. The bad guys are sometimes easy to miss despite their distinctive outerwear. Baddies will drive past you on the road and do nothing yet sniping one from distant cover alerts your targets entire gang of your position. On the up side, the lighting and effects are on par with other modern FPS games, the combat and weapons are well thought out and there be coop. The only reason I would recommend this game is if you plan to play with your friends. Could be fun to team up with 2 hang gliders and rain fury upon the helpless meth head mercenaries below.",6,PC
"The game is OK. It lacks the depth that far cry 2 had and very quickly becomes repetitive. The graphics are OK, again compared to fc2 when that came out..disappointing. A lot of the things I liked from fc2 have been removed in favour of suiting child like play styles, which given the language in this game, leaves me confused. Then there's the storyline, some spoilt rich kid all of a sudden overnight learns how to skin animals, make rucksacks, ammo pouches etc, and is instantly proficient with any weapon he picks up! This IMO, makes it very hard to become the character. That said, the driving is much better in this and then side missions can be fun, dragging you away from they monotamous repetitavness that is the main SL. 7/10 as at least is a relatively good game unlike most the dross released lately, just REALLY annoyed they dumbed the game down.",7,PC
"This game is a decent shooter, the weapons are satisfying to use and there is some intense shooting, there is option to an stealth aproach and is satisfying to cleanse an outpost of enemies without been seen. However, this game isn't Skyrim tropical island version, if you are expecting deep RPG mechanics and involving side quests you are going to be dissapointed. It is a game about a guy with guns that shoot other guys with guns, outside the main storyline, you just kill alot of guys with red shirts for no real reason but only for your amusement, its a Call of Duty on a island, less scripted and with more options. If compared with Call of Duty, its a more complex game, but when compared with other open world games it's a little too shallow.",6,PC
"Rating this game is pretty difficult since with high expectations a let down often results in even poorer sometimes unfair grades. Ill try to be as fair as i can though. I liked the atmosphere of the game and since i am not a pro fps player i can kill quite some time with killing stupid npcs that have a worse reactions than my granny. Like in for example Prototype just running around ( litterally, since our hero is quite fast with all those guns and stuff) killing stuff is fun and if you dont look at all the maps and quest directions the islands are pretty well designed giving off a nice flair. Wildlife in general is way more scary than npcs especially certain water animals but wearing a shotgun eventually reliefes you of your fear of most animals. I wouldnt take the crafting system too seriously because except for the syringes rather than real crafting its more like upgrading very few predefined things like ammo pouches or quivers and its only working once so before long you only need to craft healing items anymore. Anyways i could live with all of this but i have to deduct quite a few points for bugs and/or illogical game play and game design decisions. First off, the looting is horrible and makes you switch weapons with the dead rather then taking their money. Same with skinning dead animals. It looks like the collisions are totally off at this point and this really is annoying and takes up too much time. Another huge setback is the UI. At times it litterally clobbers at you with information but when you really need it like you shot an animal and now need to look for it lying in 3 feet high grass its not helping and you can search for hours before you realize its despawned by now. Oh and whatever you do, try to avoid vehicles. Boats are kind of okay-ish i guess but almost any land vehicle gives off worse handling than an aircraft turbine powered hovercraft would have. Probably this is why even friendly NPCs may kill you by accident when you walk on the streets. I could probably go on a little more but there really are some fun things too. The world itself behaves pretty random and funny sometimes. A nice example was an enemy in a car hitting a goat on the street ending up exploding on a tree starting a fire which burned down a enemy base. Now thats bad luck! I am still giving 7 out of 10 because there is a lot potential in this one and i am really curious about what mods the community will create. Yes i had fun. PS I did not mention the story at all because its a shooter. Yes there is a story and its not really worth mentioning. Are you REALLY surprised?? Over all: Graphics 8/10 (setback water) Audio 9/10 (good soundtrack, nice voice acting i have to admit even if unecessary) Gameplay(single player) 7/10 (setbacks low difficulty, no bulletdrop, enemy AI, no real rpg however it tried - still 7/10 because its still fun and big and it has a bow) Cheers! Biz",7,PC
"10 out of 10? I don't think so. Although, I admit I'm not mad either. Think of it as Far Cry 2 with a face lift. If you've played that, then you'll get the feeling of doing pretty much the same thing as before. As a matter of fact, it feels so much the same, you may want to ask yourself if you're in the mood to play Far Cry 2 again. They added a few things. If you want to carry more... bigger wallet, bigger rucksack for items, bigger ammo case etc., you hunt animals and skin them. That was fun, but It took about an hour and I had pretty much upgraded everything. I started gathering items and cash, but here's something I found odd. As in Far Cry 2, you had to quest to make more items available. No problem. In Far Cry 3, you unlock radio towers. But here's the catch, the items aren't only unlocked, they become free. So I'm walking around with a stuffed $6,000 wallet and I've already got everything and not a single reason to loot dead bodies or pick up cash. Modifying weapons cost a little, yeah, but upgrading your favorites only takes a second and your done. Now I'm thinking, what do I do now? In other words, in two hours, there may be plenty to explore, but no reason to do it! Skills are boring too. The standard ones that increase health are obviously important but the rest are more like ""skills of convenience"" if you know what I mean. There aren't any you feel like you really want. I've got fifteen skill points and I don't even care. There's nothing there beyond increasing health and a couple of other ones that make a difference. The rest? zzz zzz. So what's the verdict? Is it worth playing? I'm not finished with it and I will finish it... eventually. Games that get the ratings this one got are supposed to lock you in front of your computer and not set you free until you've savored every morsel. This one? It's like going to a buffet where all the items taste pretty much the same. You'll play it maybe because your hungry but you won't really care what you want next. As a side note, it may be worth waiting for because there are a few bugs on the pc version. It stutters like a dog unless you can get fps over 60 on the low end. I've got an Intel 3820 oc'd to 4.2 ghz and an Nvidia gtx 680 and need to run on medium settings. I had to get the top fps to about 115 for the normal buttery smoothness I'm accustomed to. And that's borderline. If I even turn on anti-aliasing to any degree, I have to reduce the graphics to low, so I settled for medium and no AA. You can google ""Far Cry 3 stuttering"" for more info. The game has value. Think of it like Santa putting a Bugatti Veyron in your drive way but then discover the only place you can drive it... is around the block. It's fancy, but the track is the same.",7,PC
Addictive and fun. Worth every penny!,6,PC
"FarCry 3 has no sense of adventure. At all times the game tells you exactly where to go or where you can find items that you need for a quest. Best example: You enter a cave below the Doctors house where you are asked to find a motor part for a boat. Instead of letting you explore the cave by yourself the game tells you right away that the part is at the bottom of a small lake. The game is so easy it even tells you the exact position of all animals and plants that you need to collect inorder to survive. The AI is mediocre. Its pretty easy to trick enemies even on the hardest difficulty. There is a huge delay, between the time when an enemy sees you until he actually attacks you. Its probably a delay for the handicapped console controls which were not adjusted for the PC. I have played for 5 hours now and it feels like I have seen everyting already in the game. To the devs: Stop making games for 12 year old xbox kids and finally male something thats fun and engaging to play.",5,PC
"Disappointing. The pros: Great story telling, solid driving and moving mechanics, the tattoo system is fun. The cons: where to start? The game is way too easy, the enemy spotting system is too lax, especially on hard. If you're more than 50 feet away, cover is irrelevant, I've avoided being spotted in the middle of a clearing or on a beach simply by being crouched. Even though the enemy was looking dead at me and I had zero cover. Money is way too easy to get. Missions, loot boxes, corpses, selling loot items all give you tons of cash and radio towers unlock expensive weapons for free. I had the best weapons within 1-2 hours of play time. The button to pick up/swap weapons is the same as the loot button, resulting in a ton of time spent dancing around a corpse trying not to swap your FAMAS with his crappy AK just so you can loot a crumpled pack of cigarettes and 10 bucks. The voice acting for people is really inconsistent, half the islanders have a British accent. Hunting is AWFUL, animals have no kill zones, aka: no head shots or heart shots, meaning if you head shot a bear, or pretty much any other animal with a .308, he's just going to run you down and rip you to shreds. This means that the only way to hunt effectively is to bring along an LMG and riddle your prey with hundreds of bullets. Laughable. Not to mention, your character constantly whines ""gross"" every time you skin a kill. This makes sense the first 50 times or so he skins an animal, but after 30 hours of play time and hundreds of animals skinned, listening to your character whine about skinning gets very, very old. If you fail a mission, it will restart you in a predetermined location. This may not feel like a huge deal at first, but sometimes this method will drop you in an approach to a mission you absolutely would not have taken and probably didn't plan for. There were times I did something stupid and died, carrying a sniper rifle, bow and silenced pistol only to be respawned on the flat side of a map, where I had approached the mission initially from a cliff. The ability to sleep is gone, taking the dynamic of night and day away, which I feel was a real downgrade from far cry 2. This leads me into my next section on the experience. It's simply not as good. It's true that FC2 had its share of issues and frustrations, hyper-aware, laserbeam accurate enemies and checkpoints that respawned in what felt like seconds were huge gripes. But despite these problems, and perhaps because of them, the game had a really brutal, unforgiving feel. Every foray into the world was an event you planned for, you carefully managed your limited ammo supply, you waited for just the right time of day, you knew that your weapons could and would eventually fail you, you learned not to trust crappy, rusted weapons found laying around on the ground. Every mission was an exercise in planning and adaptability. You couldn't carry an LMG, a sniper rifle, an RPG and an assault rifle all at once like you can in FC3, so you had to play to your strengths and cover your weaknesses as best as possible. You had to be patient in stressful situations and fire fights because running around like Rambo was likely to get you killed. Virtually all of these things are GONE in FC3 and it's painfully obvious. Now, the game is just another exercise in sprinting endlessly (you can do that now) around a tropical island (again) and firing curtains of lead until your enemies are dead. And let's face it, we've all played that game before.",5,PC
"The game feels shallow. You earn money to fast, gain hides and plants to fast (for making bags, syringes etc.) and you have access to all weapons you want in nearly 2 hours. That's also how many hours it takes to have the feeling that you've been there and done that. The island, environment, characters etc. look good, forgiving the somewhat outdated graphics. Unfortunately every piece of the island looks the same, as do all camps, cars, trees, bushes, caves, pirates etc. So why should you explore every corner of it? Gameplay is solid; weapons handle very tight, although a bit to tight, wich makes killing foes a piece of cake. Every weapon handles the same. Driving cars is weird, you get the feeling you glide over the road with a immense and unrealistic speed. Story is a bit ridiculous, but finely interwoven in the game with scènes that make you dizzy because the protagonist (your character) shakes his head left and right, up and down like a headbanger from the early '90s. It's a shame the game gets so boring after a while, but climbing towers, getting rid of pirates in camps, going from A to B to continue the story - which is necessarry to continue your leveling progress, which forces you to stop what you want to do and follow the linear storyline - is fun the first few times you do it. But I quit after three hours or so, bored by the forgettable side-quests, story and tropical world. And i think many will not see the end of the game as well or will continue, forced to see the end. A cliche ending which can be found on YouTube; the easy solution. A",6,PC
"An unfortunate let down. The game is way to easy on the hardest difficult setting. Right when I thought it might get more difficult it stays practically the same throughout. ""Quests"" are very repetitive. Find guy, kill him. Find animal, kill it. Get medical package to location. Race against clock. That's about it. No story in quests. The reviews for the game give it so much praise but I'm baffled as to why. I really tried to like this game but even the protagonist is a pain. Half the time I wanted to kill the people I was trying to save. Why would I want to save a bunch of snot nosed American kids that only care about themselves? However, besides the kids I'm trying to save the story is decent. Overall, the game is amazing if you're not use to FPS or RPG. But other then that it's a let down. IMPORTANT: This game is pretty racist. The good guys have Australian (white) accents while the bad guys have African accents. Shame on Ubisoft for doing that.",5,PC
"I was really excited when this game came out but the end result is a bit of a disappointment. The game starts off with a strong opening scene/mission and the main antagonist is definitely more interesting than most I've seen in releases of late. Whilst I couldn't wait to start roaming around the jungle, this is also where the game fell apart. While at first it's a lot of fun exploring the lands, finding an underwater cave by chance and looking for goodies. Soon though, you will have seen enough to really care. This is especially true when you climb radio towers (18 in total that reveal more of the map when you activate them), alongside the bandit camps that need clearing to give you new fast travel/shop/quest outposts. It's highly repetitive, though this is something I can actually live with just fine. Killing relatively dumb NPC's with silenced weapons and the bow, or charging in with an RPG can be rewarding. There are some notable issues that just hurt, if not kill, the gameplay experience. For instance, you can fire a silenced sniper from 200m away and the enemy will run towards the exact location the gun was fired from. What's more that if you get detected, enemies suddenly take less damage from your weapons. A defender (with LMG) type enemy can be killed with a single headshot if he's unaware, this suddenly becomes 3 headshots if he has seen you. The crafting system isn't too bad but it doesn't make sense, why go through 5 wallets that can each hold a bit more money than the last if you could just make the biggest one straight away? That said, how can shark skin be made into a quiver that holds more arrows than 2 goat hides? You also seem to have the ability to slide down a mountain without taking any damage, but if you sprint off a small incline chances are you'll stumble and lose almost a full bar of health. If you get knocked by an enemy and you finish a quick time event to get back up, there won't be enough time to heal before you get finished off. At least let me die straight away and save the time/frustration. The list continues, but it boils down to 'illogical'. Throwing a stone 10 times and getting the same reaction out of the enemy doesn't make sense, he should be aware by the 2nd of 3rd stone something is up. It has fun driving mechanics (not perfect, but better than most games), great gunplay (unlike some others say, each gun does have unique and noticeable characteristics) and the island setting is nice and colorful (color in a modern day fps zomg!). It is simply let down by frustrations that boil down to poor design, hitting you over the head with what's under the hood and slamming you out of the experience. I'm a long way in, the story does go downhill but I still want to find out how it ends. Though I'll only be playing for an hour at a time, mainly due to the fact I'll be ****** over by the game by then due to shoddy mechanics, fail a mission and alt-F4 that **** out of frustration.",5,PC

Experience the island through the eyes of a wayward crew in their own quest to survive against the odds. The reality is its an arcade style shooting gallery on an narrow pre-defined path with no real options for exploratio.

Hustled big time, save your cash for something else if you were interested in the Co-op its complete linear garbage its been done before a million times and its very old.",5,PC
"Firstly, This is a review on mostly the features not single player content. For those curious though, the graphics are amazing. The single player game play is superb. In regards to the co-op content, it was a complete miss. Though it looks from the video that the co-op campaign is full of content, you only really get to follow a set series of short missions. The online multiplayer is a joke compared to Far Cry 2. If you want a $60 single player game then this is for you. All in all, rating this whole game, I give it a 10/10 based on single player but, since I there is no option to rate select features in this review, I have to give it a 5/10 because the rest of the content is a big disappointment.",5,PC
"Far Cry 3 should be considered yet another epic failure (remake) of the second instalment in the series, all I can say is that I would like my money back (not possible) and please stop screwing us over.",6,PC
"Far Cry 3 is a very good game with very annoying flaws. It's a great experience, but unfortunately you get kicked in the nuts here and there to remind you this game isn't perfect. First of all, this is a medicore console port. Menu is a PITA to navigate with mouse because it wont always register ""mouse hover"" event. Several lists do not get scrolled with mousewheel. Several times you cannot use enter to activate the ""Use"" or ""Ok"" or ""Next"" option. Several functions are inconsistent - in one interface, you click a button to scroll through inventory sort modes in the bottom of the screen, in other, you click left-right arrows near the top of the screen where current sort option is displayed. Overall, interface is just clunky and not optimised for PC. Controls are awful. You cannot have a hold-to-run or hold-to-crouch option. You cannot really change your mouse look precision (lowest setting is still too high for a shooter). You have to set up controls multiple times - one for your guy, one for your guy in the car, and there are numerous bugs involved (like, car part would let you assign a key that is already used for ""map"" or ""heal"" but it wont work because map or healing always takes precedence). If you ever happen to accidentatlly reassign left click to something else than shooting, you'll have to spend a LOT of time to get your shooting with left click back (just binding it back will stop your weapon from shooting, even though you can do everything else you usually do with left click in this game). Worst of all - glider and wingsuit controls are NOT reassignable. You will have to use WASD for that even if you changed your control scheme. Even worst - if you reassign your crouch key, you will NOT be able to use wingsuit at all because parachute won't open! And without it, landing on anything except water is instant death. After you get over the console portedness of the game, you will be greeted with other annoyances. First - game LOVES to take control from you and force you through long and tedious unskippable cutscenes, special interactive cutscene-like corridor levels, unskippable long phone calls that repeat every time you reload a game even if you save after hearing that call. A huge tutorial is unskippable, even if you chose ""difficulty level for very experienced FPS players"" - yeah sure, teach me how to crouch, run or avoid detection. Second - game isnt really always open worded. A lot of times you'll be ""locked"" into an area of a mission, being unable to leave (leave = you went out of combat zone mission failed forced reload). Third - game constantly makes you pause for actions like map, skill allocation, crafting... this is even more ridiculous than eating on pause in Skyrim. You can make leatherwares, craft medicine of insane properties (like 30 second invulnerability or quad damage) on PAUSED so you dont really need to stock up on any medicine - just bring the reagents with you. This really breaks immersion and constantly takes you out of the game. They could make it like in FC2 where you take out map to look at it, or you'd sit down to sew/craft syringes, look at your tatau to chose which skill to pick next, anything! But not this. However, when you get past all this, Far Cry 3 is a great experience. Its very fun, it feels like truly open world, you can do a lot of stuff, crafting and minigames and activities ARE involving and addictive, hunting treasure or animals is fun and overall, yes, this game is good. If you can manage the bads...",6,PC
"The people praising this game are right, there is ""plenty of **** to do"" here. If only that wasn't so literal. It's just as shallow a pretty sandbox as Far Cry 2 was. Good shooting mechanics, nice graphics. But while 2 was a decent shooter with unparalleled immersion-enhancing lack of HUD, this one at its hardest is Baby's First Shooter that adds all the boring **** that's wrong with games nowadays. There's several types of missions. Story missions are rather scripted, but contain some of the best and most elaborate fights against numerous enemies. Hunting is fun for about 10% of how long you're expected to do it. Tower climbing was sold as puzzles, but it's just climbing. No two towers are the same, that's true, but so far (11 hours in, 60% of map cleared) no thinking was required. Missions where you have to kill a specific guy with a knife tend to be rather good, but pose no real challenge. Driving missions are short and tend to be very easy. Missions in which you help the local populace are shallow fetch quests -- go a hundred meters to the east and kill three dogs, please, hero who liberated 75% of our island and killed hundreds of our enemies. Driving feels better than in 2, but racing and supply drop missions are way too easy, failed them just once or twice. Collecting plants is a chore, and it's not even necessary (seriously, you have a skill that heals four bars with no medicine necessary, just adjust the wrist and off you go). The best part of the game is emergent gameplay, the weird interactions between the wildlife, enemies and friendlies, when you're on foot, setting traps to patrols and attacking strongholds. Also flying to a new location and exploring. Once you liberate a new place, the interesting part at that place is pretty much done. The HUD, what's to say? Creeping to stab a guy in the neck, ""HEY GO TALK TO BUCK"" reminder dances in the corner. Real immersive, good job failing basic game design. I'd certainly forget about the main mission if it wasn't for your helpful and **** reminders obscuring my vision. So thanks for that, Ubisoft Montreal. It's too easy, like it was balanced and playtested only for playing with the gamepad. Hardest difficulty, I never use medicine, never buy armor and can take two or three outposts without refilling on bullets. There's never any real pressure, I die only if I'm messing around. The 3D marker + wallhack is ridiculous. The second Far Cry was, in my opinion, great. I viewed it as Space Invaders, jump in and have some arcadey fun -- it was repetitive and shallow, but SO trim, only shooting and no fat anywhere. If FC3 was the second and FC2 was the third the critics would be all like ""they distilled it to what matters"" and ""finally the ancillary RPG junk is gone"" and ""the UI is a stroke of genius, removing the minimap makes things so tense"". This game is like a kitchy dumb blockbuster consoly guilty pleasure. I couldn't put it down for about ten hours, but there was so much pointless grinding and the fights have gotten SO EASY, I could have just gone anywhere guns blazing, bombs exploding, bear cavalry clearing the way. I needed to set myself restrictions to have fun - weapon spotting and reticle off, never once using the camera, no fancy arrows, just molotovs and grenades, no armor. Still too easy, shouldn't have crafted so much ammunition pouches. Perhaps autoleveling enemies' weapons in FC2 was a good idea and it certainly had a better UI with the physical map and no text on screen. It's a far cry from the refined gameplay we were promised and all the junk they squeezed in there is grating. I also made a mistake of choosing skills that sounded useful, so I could move faster crouched, bring up iron sights faster, heal four bars without having any resource (!), reload while sprinting. Death is completely optional in this game. I think I'm going to play Stalker: CoP next, I can appreciate its dangers much more after the sterile kiddie playground of Far Cry 3. The glowing reviews for this game seal my opinion that professional reviewers can't tell **** from shinola. I can't see anyone with a history of shooters playing FC3 for more than five hours and giving it such a high score. The tension and difficulty are simply gone. Didn't mention the story. It's crap, but I expected crap and that's perfectly fine. It took a HUGE step back from the second one in this department as well - the Jackal tapes were masterpieces of videogame writing: ****/wiki/Jackal_Tapes , while Vaas and the gang are plastic figurines of caricatures of tropes. It's a stupid blockbuster that didn't manage to kill everything that was good about FC2, but comes damn near. The honeymoon lasts for some ten hours if you press on and disregard the stupid minigames and shallow sidequests, then it's ten more hours of boring grinding if you don't abandon it.",6,PC

"[European] Far Cry 3 is an ok shooter, a bad RPG and a good Adventure game. The Shooter - 6/10: The shooting mechanics are good and it is a lot of fun to sneak around with a knife and when you manage to complete an entire quest using knife only you feel like a SHADOW OF DEATH. However the long animation associated with looting or doing take-down kills can leave you vulnerable for a bit to long. The AI is acceptable, sometimes it feels like it is tracking you to well and sometimes but often it it just stupid enough for you to have fun trying to trick it. There are a fair amount of weapon types and while most of the guns feel very similar there are still enough variation and ability to equip different sights, attachments and colors that it feels satisfying. However there are some strange bugs with weapons that have extended clips that they are never full up on ammo when you get them from the shop and this is where the RPG element shows it's ugly head. The RPG - 4/10: You can level up, craft items and larger bags to carry stuff in, problem is that you unlock the skills by progressing the story and you earn so much xp that you will always have skill points hanging around waiting for you to do more story missions. So why they don't automatically unlock these new ability when you progress is a mystery to me. This is doubled by that the keyboard and mouse controls in the menus are really clunky. The crafting is also under developed you will have crafted all the pouches you can when you are a quoter way into the game and after that skinning animals is pointless and you try to avoid all animals in the world. You can still craft syringes that can help you in various ways however i played the game on hard and never used anything other than the healing syringe that you start with. The looting of enemies is also a bit of a downer, you only get money and on the rare occasion some ammo or grenades, but nothing that really feels worth your time and while it is fun to unlock new weapons and attachments for the weapons once you have unlocked all the mechanic falls completely flat and there aren't enough signature weapons (unique weapons you buy that have attachments combinations and colors that the normal unlocked ones don't have) to keep you going. The health system is a bit strange, you regenerate partially depleted health bars automatically but not empty ones and you take so much falling damage that while exploring you will lose a bar now and then, the only way to regain that health is to use a health syringe or if you are out of those you can use your healing skill, however since you don't want to waste healing syringes you will end up playing 90% of the game with 1 or 2 bars of health missing. The Adventure game - 8/10: The most fun part of the game is roaming around the beautiful island, unlocking GPS towers and camps are a lot of fun and provide a nice challenge, problem is that once you have unlocked all towers and camps there are basically no enemies left in the world and everything but the story feels pointless. However it will take you some time to do this so it is a minor problem. The main character is annoying but the story is good and you will meet some very enjoyable characters along the way. I do however feel that they have taken a step back from FC2 in not letting you chose your character, it would have been nice if there was a choice to play as either a male or female lead and this could easily have been integrated into the story. Also the Checkpoint/Save system is a bit weird sometimes working well and at other times not as much, I thought FC2 did the adventure save system better with your friend showing up to save you. Conclusion: It is a good game, while I do miss the red Hawaiian shirt I did still have fun with this game and I do look forward to Far Cry 4. P.S Ubisoft FFS get rid of the !#%& Uplay, I hate this stupid thing, what was so bad about FC2 system? Install and play and if you choose to go online you needed a CD-key, that was a perfect system!",7,PC
"Far Cry 2 was a promising sandbox but it was boring after a little, not a bad game, but nothing exceptional. Far Cry 3 is... exactly the same, just bigger and more cod-generation oriented. Devs decided that to improve the game the right path was adding long and unskippable cinematics and Tarantino's style npcs, basically following the trend of any recent fps, it seems they all want to make movies nowadays.. It was not a bad idea itself, but the exectuion is poor, the story is brainless linear garbage, there is an island, some npcs helping you without any reason, bad guys got red t-shirts, good guys got blue t-shirts, you are a student with no military background who suddenly starts going around with rocket launchers and assault rifles doing rambo, killing dozens of ""pirates"", primary following a linear main quest arc, helping villagers following mostly terrible side quests, also its really bad imo the fact in this game you basically got unlimited ammo and weapons as there is a dealer every village and you can teleport there in any moment. The game mechanic is uber repetitive as side quests and activities, and also its really ruined by the fact this game is made to be played with a joypad. Beside the forgettable main quest plot, there are side quests which are all forgettable too, worse if possible then the main quest, usually excessive dramatic illogic situations, then every time the player conquer a camp there are more quests which are always the same 3, one hunting quest, one assassination quest, , and a driving quest (driving is terrible in this game btw), all three quests are very boring and after one day i started to skip them except the hunting which is needed for the in game crafting system so they are a must. This game is similar to Dead Island as kind of sandbox game, great presentation, tedious and repetitive gameplay with tons of issues and illogic and poor devs choices. The rpg side of the game is not interesting, the abilities you can unlock will be all unlocked going on so there is no sense of developing a specific trait and character. This game offers unlimited ammo and weapons as you can fast travel to any camp at any moment and refill with everything, there is no option to change this in game and imo it ruins a lot the basic idea of the plot where the player should be a desperate survivor moving into a dangerous territory. The game is also badly ruined by the fact its developed as a console game, it happens quite often but this game is terrible cause this aspect, so its not only the fact its developed with console menu style, but its really developed to be played with a joypad, to a point where playing with keyboard + mouse is a problem, keybinding is not enough customizable, especially the special abilities are impossible to keybind after the first 2, at least using the menu, didnt check if there is an ini to tweak but comon its 2012. The inventory and menu system is by far the worse ever seen in gaming hystor, selling and buying stuff is terrible, and overall the menu system is absurd. The mouse movement is not totally smooth, tryed with razer and logitech gaming mouses, basically it feels a bit unresponsive compared to any good fps, and it lags badly while in the menus. Another great problem is the checkpoint save system, who invented this terrible mechanic should be banned from gaming developing. If a console user may be used to this system due to old time console limitations, for a pc player this is something out of any logic, if it happens you need to shut down the pc for any reason in most occasions you will have to see again a long brainless cinematic and redo all the mission from the start, for me its a big issue. Graphically its sub-par surely cause the console limits actually are impressive compared to what can do a new pc, I guess Crysis one looks better then this, anyway its not my main concern. At the end i find mostly this game irritating me cause the console style menu/inventory and game mechanics developing, anyway even if all those issue would be solved the game is still boring itself and doesnt have the quality that professional reviewers are trying to sell us.",5,PC

"I was so wanting to like this game. Having invested a few thousand hours in FC1 I thought this might be it's spiritual successor. The island IS beautiful, the art work is great. My biggest criticism are the numerous pop ups telling you of the current quest and warnings. Also (and i find this a weird design decision) all interactive items in the world glow so you know what you can open or take but when you get close enough there is another pop-up telling you which button to press to get the item. The mini-map is too far away from the edge of the screen. There is an enemy detection ring bang in the middle of your field of view; at this point in time this cannot be turned off. Why enemies couldn't be displayed on the mini-map is beyond me. You do not ""find"" loot as it is marked on the mini-map. The sand-box experience is somewhat broken by having to complete a mission before being allowed to wander off exploring. In summary a great let down.",5,PC

The endless slow walking parts, corridors, ladders, crawling and soulless side quests take the flow out of the game. Could be good if it was 10 hours long, but they dragged it out by adding all these tedious, boring parts turning it into a 30+ hour game.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"Runs smooth at 60fps.....that's the positive. The game is a tedious over long borefest. Absolutely terrible pacing in order for the game to be split into 3 parts.

The combat initially seems okay, but by the time you have encountered the same enemy types a few times it becomes a chore. I've never wanted a game to end so badly as this.

"I'm one of those people, who haven't played the original FFVII. Before I started playing this Remake, I've played the Final Fantasy XV as my first FF and completely loved it. So I got into this game with really high expectations and got heavily disappointed. Main and side characters: First, the characters in your group are really annoying. Jessie literally screaming at you every second to ""not go there, go right"" in one of the beginning main story quests already got me being annoyed so hard at her and her annoying character in front of Cloud just made it worse. Characters, including Cloud, are also VERY naive, walking into buildings full of enemys thinking they don't get caught etc. In addition to that, the conversations are so... Flat and boring it's ridiculous. Fighting / control system: The fighting system is just weird. I've never played a game before where you have to attack with square - and also can't even change it. Items in combat can only be used when you have ATB - so if you are almost dead you can't use vita magic nor items when your ATB is low?! Also, when walking around normally, you can't even jump or roll around the world. Like literally Cloud can't jump the most little rock. In some places, he randomly can't walk faster and you have to walk slow just because someone behind you talks to you. Fast Travelling: Fast Travelling is introduced so late that you don't even need it anymore. Before that, you literally have to run through the same miles long streets 2-3 Times so you are already bored and annoyed. Also, Fast Travelling is so much more expensive (300 Gil in a game where you have little amount if items to sell) than in XV (literally 5 Gil and you can get rich so fast). Story: I don't know if it's because of I haven't played the original game but I don't understand anything of the story. There is no introduction to the world with Mako, reactors etc nor whats exactly the problem with it, it's like everything is lacking of information. Same for the SOLDIER thing (1000 times they said to Cloud ""Oh you're a SOLDIER!"" but NO explanation of what this is.). You get a few more information really late in the game but they still don't answer the questions and just come way too late. Because of this, I lost track of the story in game really fast even more and also got heavily bored by it. If you can't explain it so I at least rarely understand it, then don't make a game. I also had the feeling that there were soo many Cutscenes which where just unnecessary or way to long for what they wanted to tell me. Bosses and Fights: Too repetitve. There is a scene where you fight on a motorcycle for example. The first time it's cool and something different. Why doing the exact same thing again in Chapter 17? Also, there are 2 or 3 bosses you have to fight two times in the main story and there is almost no variation in enemys around the world / game. Side quests: I don't even want to say much to this. The side quests are so damn boring and unnecessary that I just did the ones I was ""forced"" to. Graphics: the only thing that was really positive on this game. Liked the graphics, especially the look of the cutscenes. Some other positive things: Liked the idea of items in sale in a few places. Also, the map is pretty ""linear"" and you never have huge problems to find out where exactly you have to go for the main story. I like the fact we can control the other characters in fights too, as some of them are way more effective against some enemies than Cloud. Overall, I will definietly not play Rebirth, most probably not even when it's free in PS Plus one day.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
Worst combat system in any game ever. The combat is so bad you will constantly want to install the game. No way developers played this and thought it was okay. Just imagine worst of strategy elements and worst of action elements. You combine these two together get this combat.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
"This is not a remake, just a fanfic that is disrespectful to the original material and the fans of the compilation. Ghosts of fate? Time travel? Multiverse? This is not Final Fantasy VII and this game is not a Remake, it is a bad joke.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"I had to force myself to finish it, apart from a few moments ok everything is long boring and without interest.Brrrr motorcycle passages what boredom.Corridors etc.I do not understand how we can note 89 such an astron.Ok nostalgia, but you have to open your eyes, Square Enix they haven't made a good FF since 12 ??",0,PLAYSTATION 5
Quick review: - bad gameplay - bad linear maps - bad fetch quests - bad story changes - bad technical issues (textures popup and framerates drop) These are the main issues I've found in this disappointing Remake of a classic like FF7. I suggest you to don't waste your money in this incomplete and boring reboot.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
"In the original FF7 you take up to 5 hours to get out of Midgar.In the remake the whole game corresponds to this part.How did they make 5 hours yield 60 hours?Yes, with the biggest sausage filling in the history of the video game.Otherwise the game makes a graphic appeal with all generic or uncharacterized content.A strong disappointment.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"Sadly another bad joke produced by Nomura with the Square Enix money. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a fanfiction story that was inspired by the original game story just for changing all the chain points of the whole plot. Also adding a horrible action gameplay, and a bunch of atrocious fetch quests in the corridor maps. One of the most disappointing FF games ever",1,PLAYSTATION 5
"The second half of this game is a mess and is written in a way that only people who played the OG will understand - literally every character acts like they understand what happened, but it's just confusing. What's the point of playing a game if it doesn't tell you what to fight for? After finishing the ending I was scared to play Rebirth.Still, it has a pretty decent play through the middle. The character's acting is awkward and fairly boring.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"Pretentious, mediocre game that relies on nostalgia and world-building to prop up otherwise irredeemable game elements: insufferable character tropes and dialogue, an empty world on rails, a severely downgraded version of Square's action/tac hybrid combat, and sluggish and awkward story pacing. FFXVI was a much better modern entry to the franchise, in my opinion.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"Worst battle system I’ve ever seen. The hybrid turn based/action thing they did manages to be the worst of both worlds. Dodging is completely useless, and special attacks are picked from a menu but can still miss?? What is the point of having a menu at all then? The pacing of the game is awful. It should have been about 10 hours but it was stretched out to an agonizing 40 hours of pain.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"This game is generally a gigantic disappointment for me. Final Fantasy VII already felt pretty overhyped to me, but what a mistake it was to give this game the chance to be my first impression of that universe. The characters are great, and there are some great moments in the story of this game. But I have never experience more terrible gameplay than in this game, and even the story falls apart with a terrible ending that makes no sense and is just boring. I don't get the hype behind this game at all.",1,PLAYSTATION 5
"I have never played the original Final fantasy 7, so I was very hyped to play this game. The first two hours of the game was soo good that I would have given it a 10/10 if the game kept it up. But then, It felt like the game did everything it could to piss me off. Why I hate this game: - The level design is terrible. Almost 40% of the game is set in sewer level where you just go from Point A to B and pull lever's. - The pacing is bad. The opening act, the act in slum 5 and the last 5 chapters were good but everything else in between felt unnecessary without anything happening. It felt like it was padded out just to increase the runtime. - The characters felt flat and not very interesting. Often times they act really dumb ( especially Barats) Also the girls are adults but they act like 10 years old cutesy anime girls in a magical girl show. - The difficulty is broken. In easy they rarely attack and in normal every enemy ignores other party members and targets you. 1 in 5 battle I got to a position where enemies kept attacking and I couldn't even move or get out of their attack. The only way to overcome that is to through spells from a distance. So basically play a mage with 5ft long sword. ( Those who are saying GETGUD. Just to let you know I have beaten Sekiro and Elden Ring) - The story was good until the last 2 chapters where I didn't even know what was going on. The only reason I gave this game a 4/10 was because of it's phenomenal Soundtrack and stunning graphics. I don't understand the hype behind this game at all.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"Short story: only linear part of FF7 and no open world This linearity makes FF7 feel restrictive and dated by today's standards. While the story itself is decent, it's disappointing not being able to explore the game's imaginative world more freely. Once you leave Midgar, the areas you travel through serve as little more than momentary backdrops along a predetermined track. The pacing also suffers when you're unable to take a break from the main storyline quests.",3,PLAYSTATION 5
"I really wanted to give this game a chance to shine, but after reaching Chapter 8, I couldn't make myself play any longer. Nothing in this game feels even a bit appealing for me. Combat is attrocious with a lot of clicking around, and this half real-time and half turn based approach, next, characters are dull and behaving like children with weird conversations and hand gestures , Cloud seems like he is vaccinated from any real life feelings, and others simply over-react to any situation that comes before them. While conversations are....cannot find words to **** elementary, like some young teenagers discussions in adult characters. And then story itself, cliche would be an understatement, cause everything in this game feels cliche-ish. I'm just happy I tried this on PS Plus subscription , and haven't spend time or money to have this...experience.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

"Overall disappointing. The graphics at times are pretty, but you can easily see where all the sacrifices had to be made. This is just another SquareEnix Hallway RPG. This game has 10-20 hours of padding. Storytelling is all emotion and little to no substance. Tired Hollywood story arcs; along with the meta, near 4th wall breaking ‘Whispers’ loses all impact of the story. Characters are unlikeable. Cloud and Aerith are awful. Secondary characters like Johnny and Kyrie get too much screen time and are more meme than human. There’s also an uncomfortable alliance with ‘The Trio’ even though they are sex traffickers. This game almost glorifies the villains, and the heroes just kinda ****. Environments are static and lifeless, there are next to no interactions, or world building. In fact there are numbers of opportunity to insert lore and it’s absent. The battle system is nothing but lame lizard brain gameplay, the original turn-based system was better.",3,PLAYSTATION 5
Enemies are hard and the action is not exhilarating. The dungeon is long and the tempo is bad. The story ends in the middle of the game and is different from the original story.,2,PLAYSTATION 5
"I tried really hard to not see the Remake as a cashgrab, but even when reminding me of all my love for FF i can't help myself. Or maybe it's because of it. Sqare Enix expects you to pay more for the remake than the original ever was whilst offering less content, less playability, almost no post-game whatsoever and the outsight to pay even more for the upcoming parts god knows how many of them there will be. The only part in which the game delivers in abundance are the cutscenes, and boy do they take much space of the game. Well the problem is, i bought a game and not a CGI movie. I play games to have an active time, if i wanna sit passively on the couch i would have chosen to watch a movie or some series. I played the game together with a friend, there were numerous times someone got the controller handed just to lay it back down after holding it for ten minutes during another cutscene-fest. I know very well that cutscenes have been an important part in FF7, but the former parts usually had long stretches of free gameplay and freedom so the breaks were spread out widely and thus not interrupting the gameplay. The remake has barely any freedom in gameplay nor any interesting parts or longer stretches of pure playing, it basically feels like the game is playing you, only needing the player to get to the next loading zone starting another cutscene. I know many people view it differently, but for me cutscenes, no matter how many hours there are, are a small percentage of the whole presentation. So if it comes to rate the game, id give cutscenes a 10/10, which is great, but it only determines around five percent of the games overall rating, so you can put in as many hours as you want, it wont be a better game at the end, i dont care. I take the other 20 hours of the actual game and rate that accordingly, like the cutscenes wouldnt even exist, which leaves you with an absolute garbage game no one would even remotely think about giving a proper rating. Dont get fooled by eyecandy and looks, it drags you away from viewing things as they really are. Actual gameplay, as already mentioned, is streamlined to the max. There is not one situation in the game that needs your decisions, not even thoughts. Its as casual as it can get, feels terribly bland and its not worth at all diving into any builds for your characters, because your party isnt together anyway for the most part of the game. Dont even bother building one char as support, because chances are extremely high after the next cutscene this char will be removed from the party for another 8 hours (6 hours of cutscenes) and you need another character to do the job. Just build every char as allrounder so they can to everything on your own, it wont give you good damage or fun with different classes, but there are no real mechanics anyway that matter a lot in terms of fighting, the game, as mentioned, just needs you to get to the next cutscene, after that almost all your former gear gets useless anyway because you reached the new tier items without even realising. To the people that say ""not every gamer enjoys the hardcore-postgame and grind, some just want have a relaxing gaming time after a days work"" i will only reply: imagine getting home after a hard day, looking forward to play two hours of fine FF7 gameplay because thats all the precious time you got, then after those two hours you watched 103 minutes of cutscenes, spent 11 minutes in the menu trying to figure out if you need sth. for the upcoming fights and a whooping six minutes of actual gameplay. No thanks, how frustrating. Play Uncharted or the Last of Us if you wanna have a good casual gaming experience. For me the new FF7 experience is a true disappointment, and by **** their masterpiece into pieces, Square Enix undoubtedly showed their only aim is to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. Have fun paying 400 bucks for a 5 piece set of CGI movies with some gameplay on top of it, im gonna play the original instead and celebrate a true game.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game looks and feels pretty good, but my enthusiasm decreased drastically after I reached the 1st settlement. Side quests there were so bland and primitive that I literally don't understand what developers were thinking. Overall, this isn't a bad game, but the 79.99 price tag is eyewatering for what it is. You can play it with a PS plus subscription or wait until you can get it for 9.99 - it really is not worth more.",3,PLAYSTATION 5
"FF7 Remake is the worst Final Fantasy game I've played. A trash game badly optimized, without any kind of soul from the original game. An atrocious, monotonous and ridiculous rubbish that reduces the plot to an insipid and diluted mush with an embarrassing script and dialogue. This ""Remake"" menage to ruin every single aspect of the original story, even of the characters (since in this game they become horrible and flat stereotypes). The gameplay ****, and the ""world"" of the game has no soul, considering that Midgard is the main city of the original, in this FF7R it becomes flat and ridiculous to visit. A bad game that I do not recommend to anyone who is a fan of the series, and an embarrassing whim perpetrated by Nomura and with the concession of a Square Enix now in disarray. Avoid this messy **** because isn't worth your money.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"A boring piece of crap. Don't waste your money. This FF7 Intergrade represents what's most wrong with the gaming society today. Resell you an oldgen game, with the excuse of the ""exclusive DLC"", only to make you waste other 80$, even for a bad game like this... You should not follow this atrocious practice, otherwise they are justified to sell you 2 times the same game. Anyway, this trash game was the result of this cash grab created by Square Enix, and the childish/cringe Nomura mind. This is the objective demonstration of how much Nomura actually cares about all the people that simply asked for a faithful remake. 0 The gameplay is a mess, the plot is a cringe show of stereotype characters, and a nonsensical trash. A cutscenes every 20 minutes and a totally linear maps don't incentive the 0 exploration of the game, with also atrocious side quest. And this mess is only a portion of the original game, rewritten for create a new FF7 Compilation (again), and continuing to milk the same story for the next 2 generations...",0,PLAYSTATION 5

Who praise this crap, and who praise the idiotic Nomura's choice, are basically blind.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"Square Enix has decided to spit the face of Xbox players, refusing to offer them this remake of Final Fantasy 7 for the Midgard part.This zero pointed in note is a well -deserved boomerang return.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"Bad game for those who actually play final fantasy games. Graphics, Square Enix put a lot, and I mean a lot, of time and resources in making the characters look beautiful but everything is complete sh**. They literally put a JPEG in 1 area. But it does have great cutscenes and made a 2D world in 3D showing off more then what was originally there in the PS1 version. Sound, Has almost the same music as the PS1 version the difference is the Remake has more instruments. While the music is not bad the surrounding sounds, voices, etc. seem to not know which needs to be louder. You could be done with an objective and listening to what the game wants you to do next but you won’t be able to hear it over the people in the background talking about their day and how they hate the Shinra company, this way too often. Gameplay, Gameplay is 3rd person hack n’slash with a menu you can use to pause the fight so you can choose what magic or item you want to use. If you’ve played Kingdom Hearts, think of that but the menu can pause the fight. Playing through isn’t bad but if you want to grind like some people like to do so they can be ready for the next fight, you can’t, well sort of. You can grind but have to go to a simulator to have a better chance to level, you can grind outside but the respawn rate of these enemies is fairly long. The good is Story, It follows the same story as the PS1 version but makes a turn halfway through the game. SE added extra stuff in to pad the run time since this game is only from the beginning to leaving Midgar, if you played the original, you’ll know this is like 10% of the game. I spent most of my time on the mini game, Fort Condor. The difference in story comes like a dream, Cloud will go through the game like normal but will randomly see Sephiroth when in the original game he was never there. This begins the split in game because now you’ll be seeing ghosts. These ghosts come in when the story makes a change and tries to correct the story to the way it is suppose too. It later shows Sephiroth is behind this or at least ok with these changes. Intergrade Story, This story is taken from Yuffies point making her come to Midgar because she’s apart **** to take down Shinra. This by the way never happened. This is really it; she goes to Midgar does something that ultimately doesn’t matter she then leaves to go home, this takes all of 30 mins. Overall, If you’ve never played Final Fantasy 7 and this is your first time with this story you won’t know any better, but at the same time you won’t know how the story is supposed to be and why it is being changed or what is being changed. For those who have played FF7 and enjoyed the game, you will not like this game or not enjoy what SE is doing to the game. Even if you enjoy the story the game is a very small part of what the original game is, if they follow the original story and change parts of it. I can see SE making many main games of this Remake just to make money. They already made 2 other games branching from this game.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, but this is just too much greed for me. Since they decided to price gouge on release, I'd suggest waiting for it hit $30, and grab it then. No need to get this right away. I'd pause to consider, even if this was Final Fantasy 16. $60 is plenty for a AAA title, and nowadays you need to pay an extra $30 for the ""season scam pass"" just to get the full game.

"The rushed, quickly-made filler DLC of the horrendous remake of the legendary title Final Fantasy 7, continuing Nomura and his team's undertaking in destroying everything the original game was. Since the birth of the video game industry and up to these days, the original Final Fantasy 7 always was on top 10, if not top 3 or 2 of the best video games of all time. Go figure why the remake isn't... Go figure why the remake, while being a game 20 years later vastly better graphically, doesn't even succeed to reach at least the original game score, even here on this website ? This DLC, conveniently released barely a year after the remake title, do you will really think it can save this whole remake ? No, of course it's not... But it gives you the clear message of what this whole remake will be... A disappointing major title claimed to be a proper and faithful ""remake"" that is actually a mediocre subpar Final Fantasy title that does hold to its parents' legacy and now is (and will be) filled with rushed DLC at full-price every now and then, trying to milk money from those who, for some reasons, are happy of what the story of the legendary Final Fantasy 7 has been turned into... or those in denial of what the vast project of remaking FF7 has ended into, thanks to the revengeful shenanigan of some people who believes every story should be a Kingdom Heart ""fight fate and destiny and fans' will into a 4th wall-breaking fight against boss and ennemis impersonating them as a big F-you"".

"Even though I’m not a fan of turn-based RPGs, the original Final Fantasy VII is one of the most iconic video games of all time, and for good reason. Even though the narrative can be a bit convoluted at moments, the selling point of that game for me was the characters, their interactions, and their development. Not to mention all of the big impactful moments that keep this story so iconic and memorable. Final Fantasy VII Remake is a game that has a lot of things holding it back from true greatness in my eyes, but it still has exceptional things about it. It’s beautiful visually, Midgar has so much detail put into it, the soundtrack is phenomenal, there are plenty of funny moments kept from the original game, the combat is extremely fun and innovative, and my favorite part of the game is the characters, their interactions, and development throughout the story. For the original FF7, the English translation for the game wasn’t completely accurate, so the way characters are portrayed in it isn’t exactly accurate to how they are. For Remake, however, the writing of the characters was handled with so much love and care, and it’s awesome to see them being brought to life in this remake and see their growth with one another by the end of the game, especially Cloud. Cloud went from being a snobby, selfish **** at the beginning of the game to a more caring, heroic, and compassionate man who ends up genuinely caring about others. It’s great to see how much care was put into the character writing in this game, but many flaws are a drawback for me. For starters, there are some extremely weird and pace breaking segments of this game, like the part where you have to move the handles on these machines at the same time and direction as Tifa. It wasn’t that bad at first, but what makes it worse is that you have to do it three times, and each time it gets more annoying than the last. I also hated the mechanic where you have to move the claws around to traverse Aerith through the area, which was so extremely sluggish, tedious, and made me not want to play anymore after it. Some of the chapters in this game are also slow and not very fun, like the one that's more puzzle focused and you have to help these child spirits. It was the most slow and boring chapter of the adventure, and it’s stuff like this that makes me not want to replay this game. I also don’t like how the game doesn’t tell you things, the mostly optional side quests (thankfully), and its bloated length, taking me 24 hours just to finish the main campaign. All of these things make it sound like I didn’t like the game, but I do, it just has a lot holding it back from me loving it. Still, if you love Final Fantasy and have played the original FF7, then I highly recommend this title. And as for the Intergrade DLC, it’s alright, I don’t have much to say about it. I love Yuffie and she must be protected no matter what.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"I... don't really know how I feel about FFVII Remake in general. I do believe that it was in need of a Remake, and that this represents the visuals and spruces up the gameplay SO well, but I also think that it feels like the most ""modern gaming"" take on the franchise, and makes changes in the most bizarre of places. There are a lot of unnecessary gameplay segments that disturb the pacing of the game, and every single one feels so bloated now. I guess that's to make better use of the HD environments and all, but it makes the game feel much less cohesive. The story changes were also so strange, because they have these stupid Harry Potter dementor-looking things that pop up everytime your character tries to do something that isn't a canon event. I thought the point of a Remake was to... remake the game? This should be a way to re-experience the story for modern audiences, not provide a new take on the story that some audiences may not have wanted to play thanks to the dated nature of the original game. I heard a lot of complaints about the voice acting being too cartoonish, and while that's valid, that's probably the least of this game's issues. I don't think this was the remake that we deserved after all this time, and the fact that the full experience will end up costing about $200 kind of hurts even more.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"11 hours in, I've had enough, don't want to play anymore. The amount of unfun minigames are excessive and very boring, from picking up flowers to picking up boxes with loot crates. the story is cheesy and follows japanese anime tropes. the english dialogue audio is awful and is more bearable in japanese audio. much of the game feels like filler, there's decent boss fights but also many moments when theres nothing really happening, it feels like they're taking up time for nothing. the combat is fun-ish, its modern but theres few complex or meaningful decisions to be made. the gameplay outside of the combat is mainly corridor-to-corridor, extremely linear.

"FF VII Remake Intergrade looked good and like a solid experience so I decided to try it. It confirmed my expectations, apart from some moments in the main story that I didn't find so appealing. The side missions could have been made a bit more engaging and inventive. I didn't enjoy myself in some sections that slogged immensely, just to be thrown into some action scenes that made me vibrate with enthusiasm. The experience was good but not remarkable or consistent, nor it makes me consider going back for another run.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"This game is a caricature of the original. Chalk full of filler quests and plot holes. The graphics are great. The boss fights are well done. But Barrett voice acting is super cringe. Story has all kinds of problems. No way is this as good as the original. Not only that but it’s not even a complete game. This is a cash grab by Shinra Corp, the company formerly known as Square Enix.",5,PLAYSTATION 5
"It was close from being a generational masterpiece but the overall game really suffered from some creative decisions. Without mentionning the story pacing, the story and lore would've really beneficiated from an M rating. People underestimate this rating and it goes way beyond blood splatting and gore. See Wall Market and the prostitution + sex slavery themes that the arc talks about? Or Cloud's PTSD events? Shinra's immoral research on humans? All those strong themes really suffered from being talked under a T rating and really deserved to be explained with a mature and unrestricted perspective. When you talk about such themes, you don't take gloves as if your public is composed of teenagers because the original FF7 was geared towards a more mature audience. Now, the story pacing also suffered from all the unnecessary events and subquests that have been added to stretch out the playtime because Midgar's arc in the original only lasted 30 minutes. But fortunately, it really gets insanely better towards the end when the game really throws you epic moments after epic moments with nearly no pause at all. But still, the story pacing could have been avoided if the game was complete and tried to stick more to the original story as Nomura suggested (Whispers weren't his ideas). At the end of the day, if you're not too picky, you'll go easily through the pacing and T rating, especially with how insane and cinematic the mise-en-scene is, how fun the combats are and how full of life is Midgar (though imo, Midgar's life should have been a bit toned down in terms of mood because in the original game, the city was described as really dark and depressive where the people were not as happy as in Remake).",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Ever since I first played FF7 on PS1, I was hooked on the FF series, so I knew, that I'm gonna have to take my sweet time playing this game. With this being a reimagined and modernized version of the game, I sadly can not NOT compare this to the original FF as I write this. Obviously, graphically it is far superior to the original version, but that was the only aspect, that exceeded the original. The game struggled with the FF XIII tube-like world system - in OG FF 7, the world felt massive and open to explore (Yes, I do get that this isn't the full FF7 experience yet - the stroy continues) but this game is built the same way FF XIII was (My least favourite of the franchise so far) You watch a pretty cinematic (and they are pretty!) then you wander into a tube-like world with no real freedom to explore, mostly getting from point A to B. Then there is a bossfight and then you do it all over again. Luckily the delivery of this system is well polished and if you like games for their stories - this one is for you. I do have to wonder though, if I've never played original FF7, would I even have any idea what is going on most of the game or who is this Sephiroth dude, that just drops haikus and leaves mysteriously half of the times. I know I started the review on a bit negative undertone, but I actually did love my playthrough. It just can't compete with the original game experience, and that is fine. Pick it up if you are a FF fan - you will love it!",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"The music is amazing very nostalgic and the graphics are in most part beautiful. Unfortunately, that's where the honeymoon stops. The game is mostly filler with boring and tedious sidequest, long corridors to artificialy expand the clock time with questioniable changes that had nothing to do with the theme of the original story. It's a mix bag unfortunately, the game shines with the boss battle, challenges modes and music but all the filler added to the main story hurts the game which is dissapointing for fans of the original game.",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"I have a love hate for this game. I was a teen when this game originally released and I loved it. I realized now that the story is still great and relevant but the gameplay in this version is flawed if not broken in some battles. I prefer the original only because this was a bad execution of the active RPG mechanic. Grinding isn't really a thing you can do but it feels very necessary and even if you try it's far more time consuming than before. Weapons, items, and accessories feel really useless throughout most of the game. I feel like the game heavily relies on its active battle mechanic but too many enemies have long portions where you just wait for your bar to fill and use magic. It always seemed like I spent too much time managing which materia and equips I had instead of playing which is kind of expected for an RPG but annoying for an active RPG. There's no quick swap for loadouts and that's just a huge fail. Some standard enemy battles are way harder than boss battles. A few points had just a group of enemies that somehow wiped the floor with my team. Ones with grapples are the worst. The dodge time is incredibly specific and you can't block them. The enemies later in the game will almost always focus on the character you're playing which causes you to constantly jump around. I had moments where 4 enemies would team up and just do perpetual damage and grabs to every character I had control of. It was terrible. I still love the story. The voice acting is pretty good. The graphics look great and I rarely ran into any problems with the game as long as you keep it in performance mode. Graphics mode is choppy and slow, almost unplayable. The quality improvement is marginal so keep it in performance. All in all I like it but you can tell this was made by people who understand RPG first and active action battle last. The worst part of battle is that you can use a spell or ability and it can be canceled by any enemy at any time doing an attack on you. At some parts of the game this happening once or twice can mean you are going to run out of HP.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"This is the first final fantasy, that i have played and i liked it. The combat is incredibly fun, the story is fun, although sometimes it is hard to follow, but it will keep you hooked in, the soundtrack is incredible. There were mostly 2 things i didn't like in the game: 1) The Illusion of open world-FF7 Remake fills its world with boring and unoriginal side quests, so that the game would be longer, through my journey i haven't found a side quest, that had me interested. 2) The Voice Acting is bad, average at best, the characters have to grunt every 5 minutes, but when the voice acting is at its worse, it is kinda funny Overall the game is a flawed, but fun experience, that lays the foundation for the next two parts, which i am excited for",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game is scripted to death, it should have been a TV series, so at least you could browse a smartphone 50% of time during another ""exciting"" sequence of walking-talking along a corridor where you can move only in one direction... It's unfortunate as the visuals, the world and the ambience are pretty well done...",5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Painfully slow. The game is beautiful to look at and the combat is good, but it feels like a loooooooong slog between fights/events of interest. The story moves slowly, which isn’t that big of a deal, but there’s just so much agonizingly slow movement and dialog that I don’t think I can go any further than the 10 hrs I’ve already put into it. A huge chunk of the game is spent walking slower than real life and maneuvering around npcs while feeling like you’re walking through thick, deep molasses. I get that some of the slow movement is to mask loading screens, but I don’t think that’s true in most cases. And upgrading this for PS5, loading times shouldn’t be any issue. I never played the original so maybe I just don’t have enough nostalgia for this game, but it’s the most painfully slow game I think I’ve ever played. When it shines it does so splendidly though!",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"Final Fantasy VII Remake is an extremely flawed but worthwhile expeirence. As a fan of the original Final Fantasy VII, this game was extremely frustrating. It is not a remake but more of a retelling of the first 6-7 hours of the original game. FF7 Remake has horrible pacing issues that made me want to slam my head against the wall. What almost made up for it was the combat, the Combat was fun but not perfect, however a better time than Final Fantasy 15. The game takes the major plot points of the Midgar Section and retells it in a worse way. If it were not for the fun combat this game would be a failure. Pick up if you find it on sale.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"As a new player to the final fantasy series I was super disappointed. The only thing impressive about this game was the graphics. The characters are so unlikable, the story was bland, gameplay wise it just felt like every other button masher and got pretty boring pretty quick.

I played it because of the reviews but I’ll stick with my original take, this game has good graphics and the rest is average at best.",5,PLAYSTATION 5

"### Deutsche Review ### Ich hatte wirklich Spaß mit dem Add On. Ich beziehe mich hier vollkommen auf die Erweiterung und nicht auf Neuerungen des Hauptspiels bzgl. Performance zum Beispiel. Ich finde das die Yuffie-Episode sehr viel Spaß und kurzweilig ist. Allerdings ist die Dauer des Add Ons sehr gering. Es gibt wirklich kaum Wiederspielwert. Trotzdem kann ich sagen, dass ich gut unterhalten war. Das neue Minispiel zum Beispiel war klasse! Für den Preis erwarte ich allerdings persönlich mehr. Da bevorzuge ich dann schlussendlich doch ein Indie-Spiel in der selben Preisklasse. Aber natürlich ist es auch meckern auf hohem Niveau. Ich will mehr FF 7. Ich bekam mehr FF 7.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Good game, but definitely overrated and way inferior than the original. It is also not a ""remake"", but a ""reboot"" or a ""reimagining"" of FFVII, with important changes in the story. It is also important to note that this is not the whole experience, but the 1st part of what it might become a trilogy. Technically its a marvel, and the OST is one of the best of all time. However, none of this is important considering the game that it ""remakes"". Everything that is taken from the original game stands out, amd few elements are even improved (more screentime for secondary characters gives depth). But unfortunately, many elements have been either dragged on (to infinity) or dumbed down. Story changes aside (there are many, specially towards the end, but they are kinda subjective), the lenght of the game is artificially increased by adding terrible secondary tasks and making irrelevant areas longer (destroyed highway or Hojo's lab for example). Combat is way less strategic than the original, and battles get repetitive even against bosses (some of them can take up to 30min). The camera is also bad, and we are often unable to tell what is even happening, specially with lots of enemies, flying foes or huge bosses. Summonings are great, but they don't appear many times. Overall, less challenging and deep than the old turn-based system. The PS5 version is definitely the way to go, as 60fps and improved loading times are a gamechanger. The DLC is nice (a bit too short though) and introduces the old character of Yuffie to this new version of the story. Good game but drastically overrated just because of its name.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"The game itself is great, but not worth releasing on its own for full price. The PS5 upgrade is free and the DLC is $20. I've often seen the PS4 version as low as $30, so this really shouldn't be more than $50. The new content is kinda minimal. Just some new cutscenes with the crew and pretty much everything else is Yuffie. If you don't like her, this really isn't worth it.",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE (PS5) ""The New Standard for all Remakes/Remasters"" (+) Presentation (+) Characters (+) Performance (+) Combat FFVIIR features some of the most breathtaking characters, material quality, and environments to date. The presentation excels that of most AAA games and is nearly incomparable to its original. Characters are likable, relatable, and brought to life as I became well invested in their adventures throughout the game. Although it’s not a 'new' feature as it leans heavily on its original material, it is still executed well here. Performance is outstanding as the game is extremely well developed as I experienced no bugs, crashes, or glitches throughout all my playthroughs. The combat in this game can either be overwhelming or simplistic depending on the difficulty you play at. I recommend at least trying the hard difficulty (unlocked after first playthrough) because it encourages you to plan your attacks, Materia use, and ability use. Its real time strategy reimagined in a tactical modern-day age and executed to near perfection. (-) Traversal (-) Finale (-) UI/UX Extremely outdated traversal as it is easily the worst part about this game. Slow walking, numerous cutscenes, and linear corridors interrupt the flow of the game in nearly every one of the 18 chapters. The Yuffie DLC aims to get rid of these annoyances by allowing you to sprint more frequently and glide through traversal puzzles more enjoyably. The ending of the main game has been controversial to a lot of people, but I appreciate the effort to try something new when compared to the original. The game earns its remake title instead of a remaster. However, the last 2 chapters of this game are very repetitive and frustrating in terms of gameplay. New characters are being introduced with not enough impact on gameplay and the combat begins to fade into a grind. The user interface is inept, especially the pause menu. There are way too many hidden options buried inside unnecessary menus (i.e. why is the ‘Upgrade Weapons’ menu in its own section? Just pair it with the Materia and Equipment section since all your stats and characters are shown there. Why is chapter selection hidden in the system menu? Why is the map so underwhelming and frustrating to navigate when traversing areas with different floors or height levels? etc…). (3/5) - Above Average - Recommended at $59.99",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"While this game's visuals and technical quality carry over from the original, so do the original deficiencies. Not only does it flows over, but it's heightened here because this 4-6 hour add-on is a rip-off for the asking price of $20. I made the argument with the original that Square Enix really wanted to turn the remake game into an interactive movie, and that's full-on display with Intermission. The actual game mechanics here in intermission are a redundant, pointless addition. Combat in ff7r, on the whole, is redundant. None of it adds anything to the package that Square Enix made here. Controlling characters from one objective to the next could be reduced by half and instead be infused into narrative cutscenes, and nothing would be lost. Having Yuffie play Fort Condor against other people was boring and redundant and could have just been a narrative cutscene, and nothing would have been lost. Even the majority of exploring the Shinra HQ could have easily been filled in by having cutscenes, and nothing would have changed. And that's the biggest problem with the project; so much of the game has a ""Game"" forced into a story-driven retelling. And it's here solely because if they had made this into an episodic interactive movie, the base would have flipped out. But instead of trying to make their vision into a game, they stubbornly went forward with their initial idea and jammed in a half-baked ""Game."" Intermission suffers immensely from this hamfisting the stilted game mechanics from the base while reusing an absurd amount of assets and then charging you $20 for the privilege! Does Yuffie's chapter add anything? Combat and game-wise? Nothing. Narratively? Plenty, but in the actual campaign and the ending scenes. But was that worth the cost you had to pay? Not even close. This should have been FREE for owners of the deluxe edition and at a maximum of $5 for everyone else. This chapter effectively turned a $60 game into an $80 game, and nothing about it warrants the cost. This doesn't bode well for the series, as the rest will obviously have to follow suit (as this is a singular game). I wish Square would admit they really don't care about making video games and instead go ahead and start focusing on their real vision of user-controlled interactive movies. This middle-of-the-road approach hampers everything.",5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Another cash grab from Square. This one fancier than most though. Pulling a Peter Jackson's Hobbit adding to the story tedious new parts to drag it through multiple full games and changing the great original plot to the same old Nomura tricks that erase the original's legacy. And now cashing for characters that should have been there from the beginning such as Yuffie. Oddly paced, badly written, the combat system, visuals and soundtrack elevate it from being a bad game.",5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Way too short, I expected more content since this is only supposed to be the midgar section of ff7. But they really haven't added that much. Most of the gameplay is walking really slowly through hallways and alleyways. I feel like this game exists solely for people to see high res pics of the characters they enjoyed from the original game. Because the textures outside of the character models are really bad, Sometimes ps2 level. The voice acting is okay, I expect a bit of campiness from jrpgs. I can't stop imagining Futaba from P5 every time Jessie talks though. She should have changed her voice a little bit. Might as well have Nolan North play Cloud. The lip syncing is absolutely awful and ruins the immersion. I don't get how they could mess it up this badly. Nothing anyone says looks organic, Even during the otherwise beautiful cutscenes. Battle system is pretty fun, Good mix of the original atb system and live action. The music is also well done, Captures the essence of the original soundtrack while still sounding new. Side missions are garbage filler though. There is no reason ff7r needs to be a 3 disk $210+ game other than square is trying to milk us for our money and give us as little in return as they can. Not worth full price, $40 at best. It seems dishonest to call it ""ff7 remake"" without distinguishing that its only part 1 and only makes it halfway past disk 1 of the original.",5,PLAYSTATION 5

"The Last of Us Part II is a game that evokes mixed feelings in me. While the first part was an unforgettable experience, the second part, unfortunately, disappoints greatly. It's not about the graphics, which are impressive, nor about the gameplay mechanics, which have been improved. The problem lies in the plot and the way it is **** my opinion, the biggest downside is the forced inclusion of the character Abby. I understand that the creators wanted to show a different perspective, but the way they did it is simply frustrating. The game practically forces the player to spend a significant amount of time controlling Abby, a character who is hard to like, and on the contrary - she evokes strong negative emotions. The inability to skip this part of the game is a huge mistake that ruins the whole experience. I tried to eliminate her in hundreds of ways and nothing - you have to endure **** Joel... God, I will never forgive the creators for what they did to him in this game! It was simply cruel and senseless. A character who was the foundation of the first part, treated in such a brutal way. And by Abby, whose life he had saved before! It was like a stab in the **** sum up: The Last of Us Part II is a game that has its pros, but the cons definitely outweigh them. For me, it's a big disappointment after the first one. If you are looking for a game with a great atmosphere and a cool hero, it's better to stick with the first part.

A pretentious trainwreck that hasn't heard the word ""subtlety"", it tries preaching kindergarten level lessons while trying to guilt trip its' players into feeling bad about actions they have no way to avoid because of a complete lack of agency.

"While this game boasts incredible visuals, detailed animations, and intense action sequences, I found myself conflicted about the overall experience. The storyline is where it fell short for me. Character deaths often felt unnecessary, and many of the protagonists made decisions that were difficult to relate to, which ultimately made it hard to connect with or care about their outcomes.Narrative direction aside, I also felt that some themes were overemphasized in a way that disrupted immersion. I have no issue with the inclusion of diverse characters, including LGBTQ+ representation, but at times it seemed forced or overly prevalent, particularly in emotional scenes that already struggled with subtlety. Characters like Ellie and the addition of Lilly, a trans character, could have added depth, but their arcs occasionally felt more like messaging than organic storytelling.Furthermore, the portrayal of nearly every female character with some form of emotional instability or trauma felt unbalanced and, at times, **** the end, while I appreciated the technical mastery of the game, the narrative left me feeling detached.

Also isn't it weird that Sony will censor any hint of sexual content in their games and even other games in their store but when it comes to this game, they let Neil Druckmann go all out creating the most disgusting unnecessary sex scene in video game history, just because they are delusional enough to think that he is creating art.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

Neil knew this very well, which is why he put Joel in the most important parts of the trailer. We wanted to play as him because we had already built empathy for him in the first game—we accepted him with his rights and wrongs. We also saw Ellie as our daughter.What does this game give you, brother? Why should I care about the doctor’s daughter? We killed tons of people already because they were going to kill Ellie. Everything before that was just about survival. Why am I forced to empathize with Abby? If the game is about revenge, then why am I forgiving this girl at the end? What about the hundreds of people we killed just to reach this woman? All of it is dismissed just because of a brief Joel flashback?And what about Joel directly saying his name before dying? Isn't that completely out of character? What happened to the cautious man we knew? How did he suddenly soften up and trust complete strangers? The reason is obvious—Neil Druckmann’s collaboration with Anita Sarkeesian.Look, the game even includes a whole backstory for why a trans character is trans. Who the hell cares?

This idea of Druck was rectified into not being part of the story. Saner voices prevailed, and we got a great game out of it.

"Yeah, The Last of Us Part II was a complete disaster in terms of storytelling. It took everything that made the first game so compelling—its emotional depth, nuanced characters, and masterful pacing—and threw it out the window in favor of shock value and forced social commentary. The decision to brutally kill off Joel so early, and in such an unceremonious way, felt like an intentional gut punch to longtime fans rather than a meaningful plot development. The entire revenge arc felt hollow, especially when the game forced you to play as Abby and tried to make you sympathize with her after everything she did. It was like the game was punishing players for caring about Joel and **** then there’s the Fireflies, a supposedly major faction that gets wiped out as if they were nothing. The story just felt rushed and careless, prioritizing subverting expectations over delivering a strong, well-crafted narrative.This wasn’t a sequel—it was a misguided attempt to push a social media-fueled agenda, stripping power away from the original creators and replacing their vision with something that catered to trends rather than storytelling. It could have been great, but instead, it turned into a frustrating, disappointing mess.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"I didn't like the story and characters. Graphics were good, but that was expected. Overall i don't consider it as canon and i'm going to treat Part 1 as the only game in this series.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
imagine loving a remake to a game that's only 2 years old and loving the slop and people say Sony is good,2,PLAYSTATION 5
"I was one of the people who managed to stay away from every trailer, leak or other ways that could have spoiled me before the game... Looking back at it, I wish I would have seen the leaks and been able to save my 80€. If this would have been just a random game it might have earned a 6 out of 10 for the effort and for trying, but for what naughty dog was able to deliver in the past, this feels like they didn´t care at all about the story or the characters of the first game. This game is just nice to look at but you have to be able to completely shut down your brain, not know or not care about the first game and just want to enjoy nice graphics. The writing in this game feels like a low budget teenage high school soap opera. The graphics are sadly so good that you can see the bad acting, and I don´t want to say the actors are bad, but the characters and dialogs really just feel shallow and are surly directed by someone who doesn´t have contact with a lot of real humans. Most of what happens, happens because of unbelievable coincidences (also called bad and lazy writing) and almost nothing that the characters do is relatable or even just true to how you know them from the first game. This truly is ""Game of Thrones Season 8"" Naughty Dog style mixed with ""Terminator dark fate"" with the twist that they try to make you sympathise with the Terminator who killed John Connor for 10 hours, but giving you nothing to be able to. I could go on for days but overall: if this game was made to make gamers feel stupid for caring or trying to bond with video-game characters and showing them that playing games is a waste of time, then the message was delivered 10/10!",2,PLAYSTATION 5

"This game is a slap in the face to everyone that loved the first game. Do not buy this and save your money. The truth and context of this game is much worse than the leaks. Before I get into one of the worst stories ever. The gameplay is very average in today's modern gaming generation. There are minor improvements from the first game and enemy AI is dumb as ever. There are more cut scenes and walking than actual gameplay. SPOILER ALERT..... they destroyed all of your favorite characters. They dumb down Joel's character on purpose to make him weak and stupid. In the first game he was very smart and had a ton of experience. He didn't even trust a guy that was sick on the road. He chose to run him over. Later we find out that stranger on the road was not sick and it was all a set up. They do everything to make you dislike Joel and continue to spit on him. They have a trans female/male shoot him in the leg and torture him with a golf club right in the first 2 hours of the game. They spit on him literally. They made Ellie unlikable and a selfish human being. She kills everyone and continued to blame Joel for saving her life. She cared so much in saving humanity because she has the immunity but instead she became a lesbian and chose not to reproduce. Let that sink in. She even let's Abby the one that tortured and murdered Joel in front of her get away with it. Abby also bit off two of Ellie's fingers. Her letting Abby go is basically saying Joel deserved dying. A loveable character who is the main character of the game. There was no justice for Joel. This game robbed everything from you just for shock value. The current narrative of destroying the male character to make the female character rise is very weak story telling. It is disrespectful to both genders. Females even hate it. Worst of all the pacing of the story is horrible. You literally play as Abby the character we hate for half the game. They tried so hard to make us like her but none of it worked. This game is a waste of time and money and should have never been created as a sequel. The critics are liars and they don't care about what the fans want. They only care about their political narrative and force you to like something that you will never accept. Then they insult you by calling you names because you don't like the product they are praising. They are the worst kind of human being. Trust the gamers that actually love playing the kind of video games you like. Those are the ones who you should listen to. Vote with your wallet and avoid this dumpster fire. Why care for a game created by a studio that is run by Neil Druckmann who is a male feminist and does not care about the fans and the people he works with. That's why 75 percent of Naughty dog left the company due to how he treated them. This game is created by people that don't care about you and backed by people that hate you. The game wasn't made for the fans and gamers. Vote with your wallets and avoid this at all cost. Especially how they are trying to trick everyone with false advertisement into buying this. Look it up on YouTube. Don't trust the shill media. Watch the negative videos about this game and you will see the **** to The Last of Us franchise. stole this from another user. i love the gameplay style, but everything else is garbage.49 people found this helpful.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"A pretty bad game in the narrative, the conflict is understandable but then it declines a lot, the way it develops is terrible. Playability and graphics are at a high level but in history it falls apart, a game that is based completely on the narrative cannot fail in narrative. It is a shame that the game was far from the expectation. and it's not a relatively big game to remaster, it's not even a big saga, barely having two titles. and they already release a remake of the first installment and a remaster to the max. On the other hand, the sound section is very poor, it seems more like a remix of the music from the first game and with some new ones, but nothing memorable.",3,PLAYSTATION 5

This is an unnecessary remake for the PS5. The original game already looked great and ran well on the PS5 and this remaster was more like 10$ DLC than an actual remaster. The extra content was fun but still didn’t feel substantial enough to warrant calling it a remaster. Overall fine but unnecessary. Also the director’s commentary didn’t make bizarre decisions behind the story any more clear and overall still a very bad story and sequel to one of the best game ever made.,3,PLAYSTATION 5

We go from a consistent story to one that abuses sensationalism to get ahead. As long as you don't pay attention to it, you can continue ahead since the gameplay is entertaining, and the graphics are brilliant.

"Well, what's to be said that hasn't already been said, eh? The game was leaked with negative reception at what was to come. Deceitful advertising and pleas of open-mindedness from Neil himself. I did not play this game when it first released because of what I learned was in the game. I chose to try it out upon it's PS5 release as it wasn't insultingly priced at a full $69.99 US upon it's release, and yet I still feel like that money was better spent elsewhere upon my completion of the game. I gave this game an honest chance, and tried to see if what the writers intended for me to feel would work, and it didn't. I don't care about Abby, Lev, or any of the other forgetful cast members that were throwaway characters with one-dimensional personalities. Ellie lost all the personality that made her memorable in the first game, and I don't think it necessitates mentioning how the writers felt about Joel given how quickly they dispatched him in the plot. The only reason my score is a 1 and not a 0 is because of the efforts of the teams that put together the spectacle that was the world itself. It's beautiful, the animations are amazing, and the combat is visceral. Such a shame the talent for this visual spectacle was wasted on this poor excuse for a game. Oh well, Neil got to make his revenge story game and that's all that matters to him, and used identity politics as a shield for bad writing and story decisions. Clearly I'm just a homophobic, sexist, transphobic bigot who can't stand to see a glorious work of modern art for what it is. 1/10 Neil. Do better.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

I totally disagreed; I loved and still love the 1st part. But only after playing the 2nd part did I understand what that guy meant. In the first part, we had the strongest plot with an ideal evolution throughout the game, and we were forgiving of the somewhat similar and monotonous gameplay.. But nothing like this here. I can't understand the main characters, I don't want to follow their decisions, and I want this game to finish as soon as possible.

This is a story game without a game. I find it inexcusable that the main thing in the game is a story in which mistakes are contained in literally every word of the story.

"The Last of Us 2 boasts some of the most impressive visuals and motion-capture acting in any video game. Indeed, it sets the bar for the latter. The game itself, however, is too often an after-thought next to the poorly constructed story. The player has zero agency: you will spend the vast majority of this terribly paced 30-hour campaign walking-and-talking or watching a cut-scene. Which brings us to the key issue with TLoU 2, the narrative. The story goes out of its way to not only reframe the events of the first game to fit a particular narrative, but to assassinate the original protagonists. The central theme is laughably simplistic, heavy-handed, and at no point examined critically. In the few brief moments where one is reminded of the brilliance of the original, it only evokes frustration and resentment at the knowledge that this game actively rejects and even undermines its predecessor. I cannot recommend this game to anyone, least of all those who hold the first Last of Us in high regard.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

"*score is only for the new stuff* The new content is interesting i guess, but still very little in this remaster justifies it being a new game that costs at least $10. Higher resolution and draw distance should've been available witht the PS5 patch for the original version that added better loading times and FPS. The skins are good, but even those aren't worth as much as they're charging. Everything else that was added is very low effort and just makes this remaster a cash grab: the lost levels are untouched from when they were removed while No Return is just a mini game with copy-paste content from the actual game. None of the added characters have their own models, they're just skins pasted over Ellie and Abby's movements. It also just recycles Factions content, again something that wasn't worked on for this remaster. The mode is also very underwhelming compared to how they were marketing it, and how cheaply it's put together is not what players should get from a company with Naughty Dog's reputation. For these reasons I can't give it higher than a 4; the resolution and draw distance improvements are the most worthwhile things about it, and maybe the skins if you like cosmetics in games, but even those aren't something that warrant a completely new game to be made, they're regular updates and $2-3 DLC at best.",4,PLAYSTATION 5

Dodging is utterly broken, you sway around like a drunken sailor when you aim, and there isn't much difference between characters besides a few differing stats. The game itself looks exactly like the ps4 version, you'd need a microscope to try and spot the differences. As for the game itself it's a tedious 30 hours with one of the most poorly written, convoluted plots in gaming. Not only does it radically retcon its source material it actively tries to insult the audience's intelligence. Characters gain and lose their abilities as the plot requires, huge distances of hostile territory are covered instantly (Jackson to Seattle is something like 20k miles, so 40k round trip), and characters will make choices they never would have in the first game (""hi, total strangers, my name's Joel!"") Then there's the wokeness. Oh god, the wokeness. Maybe this was considered avant garde in 2019 but in 2023 the themes and ideas feel like they were generated by a far-left AI. Gay romance, transgenderism, musclebound women, all the male characters being either disposable or irredeemably evil - you'll love this game if you're a brainwashed leftist. All of this comes at the cost of the story which is told by people who desperately need to go back to school. It takes a hardline on ""revenge"" and pushes characters to extremes that just aren't believable and in the end it all feels hollow and trite. This is a game that tries to coast by on appearances - the twisted expression of horror and anger on a character's face is simply a mask that hides nothing underneath. The people peering into the blackness of this game in search of deeper meaning won't find any - it's the proverbial black cat in a windowless, dark room. Neil Druckmann is an artist with a minimum of skill and a maximum of pretension and it oozes out of every muddled, overacted scene, convoluted flashback, and cheap gimmick to try and persuade the audience to ""see the other side"" of a conflict. An utter and thorough failure.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"After the worst sequel, the worst remastered I have ever seen. This should be a free update. The lost levels are unfinished and ""no return"" mode is pointless.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"Although the basic game is a frank success and witchcraft, this portage is simply shameful.Truffled with bugs, the basic game is barely three years old, sold at gold prices, in short, Naughty Dog has accustomed us much better.The players wanted to faction, and instead we have this scam.Note sanction for my **** adored stalker",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"The lost levels seem unfinished and the roguelike mode is **** you get a few new shirts for Ellie I guess. Unfortunatley none of this new stuff makes the godawful story and boring characters any better. Overall this remaster seems like Naughty Dog didn't really care and just shoved something out there to have something, anything after canceling Factions.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"This game is still an absolute huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $10 for an upgrade that should've been free. ""But it's only $10"" Jesus Christ, you millennials keep falling for every upsell imaginable. I don't care if it's $10 or $100, greed is greed and I'm not letting any of it slide. I need to start glueing TLOU logos on my used razors and sell them each for ""only $10"" and you Sony fanboys would be stupid enough to buy it. Looks like my trash bin will be empty because fanboys are content with trash for ""only $10"". Speaking of fanboys, remember when Rockstar and Naughty Dog fanboys made fun of COD for being the same game every year? At least there's something new every year, not to mention that ""same game every year"" was all hyperbole, whereas R* and ND are literally selling you the same games. Bet you're feeling pretty stupid right about now. Over a decade later, still no new GTA while TLOU has more remasters than actual games. Hell, TLOU has more apology letters than games. Let that be a lesson learned that you should never be a fanboy nor blindly hate on ""dudebro"" games out of jealousy. ● To be fair, there is ""new"" content in this game, but is it worth $10? The lost levels are literally unfinished levels from the alpha sold for $10. There's literally no defending that. Lazy developers didn't even bother to finish it. If this were EA or Activision, the narrative would've been so different. There is guitar free play which is something that should've been there at launch, not to mention I already got an acoustic guitar in real life. New skins, which again should've been there at launch considering how the game didn't have enough skins to begin with. So that just leaves the No Return roguelike mode, which is a joke. All the developers did is randomly spawn enemies and called it a day. Many other studios give us better game modes for free. Where is ray-tracing? Why isn't there a first person mode? Where is the multiplayer? How about improving the gameplay. Oh that's right, all of that stuff requires hard work. Deja Vu, didn't I say that in my TLOU1 remaster review? You are literally proving my point Naughty Dog. These developers are too greedy and lazy. ● How dare I complain about $10 after paying $60 and still not getting the multiplayer that was promised. It's $70 for half the game. The graphics are the exact same. The gameplay is still boring and repetitive. The physics are still trash. Everything about the campaign is still the same. The term corny is so overused when criticizing light-hearted stuff. It's about time we start using that term for arty farty games desperately trying too hard to be dark and gritty. The cutscenes are corny. I decided to do a permadeath mode run since I was just about done with this game. A couple hours later I ran into a glitch that magically teleported me somewhere and killed me. Are you freaking kidding me? I immediately ejected the disc and snapped it in half out of frustration. Naughty Dog, I don't want to see permadeath mode ever again if these type of glitches are present. There's a reason why most developers don't even bother with this mode. Time to throw this worthless game in the trash. No wait, I can sell each piece of the disc for ""only $10"" and I'll throw in a dirty sock for another low low price of ""only $10"". ● There is still no multiplayer. And the greedy developers had the audacity to make excuses for TLOU Online cancellation by claiming post-launch content will impact the development of single player titles. Nobody asked for a GTA Online scope title. All we wanted was basic PvP. That's it, we don't need your stupid movies in online Druckmann. We used to get frequent singleplayer games with PvP in the PS3 era (including you Naughty Dog) and now I'm supposed to believe that basic online PvP severely impacts the singleplayer? They couldn't even do the bare minimum by adding co-op to No Return. That's embarrassing when even no-name studios can add co-op in shovelware. That just proves that Naughty Dog's ""resources"" excuse for TLOU online cancellation is bullcrap. The real reason for the cancellation is ND are too cheap and lazy for multiplayer. Is that not true? Go ahead ND, prove me wrong. Add some form of multiplayer but you're not going to do that because you know I'm right. I don't recommend this cash grab at all.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

The key thing it sets out to do it's an absolute failure at. it's by no means a remaster and for that reason I absolutely cannot recommend it. If you're looking to play tlou2 just buy a PS4 copy it already has 60fps thanks to a patch. However if you like the game and want more the added content may tickle your fancy but as a remaster it absolutely fails and is by far the worst offender I've ever seen of this,0,PLAYSTATION 5

There might be minuscule differences in the video/audio, however it looks, plays, sounds exactly the same unless you are doing a side-by-side comparison with your Playstation 4. The lost levels are a joke, $10 for thirty minutes of content. The new mode gets a point, if you are a fan of rogue-like games. God of War Ragnarok did this for free",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game that changed how we view reviews and changed how we trust journalists is finally remastered because Sony's got nothing. I paid 10 dollars plus tax to upgrade from a copy my friend had still and I'll tell you even that might be too much for this. The game looks better from me swapping out to my ps4 on the original then looking at the remastered but it's nothing impressive. Nature looks a bit more fluid and dark areas look more toned but again you won't notice this unless you slow down and look. I rushed through the game because the story is the same and the updated graphics aren't enough to keep my attention again. I might have ignored anything new because of how boring it was playing this again so I'm sorry for not giving more attention to a remastered 3 year old game. Afterwards I tried the ""new"" lost levels and it's exactly what I thought it was. It's either levels that they didn't finish during the original production and had them sitting around or maps of the canceled pvp mode that didn't get made. This is like grabbing deleted or unfinished scenes from a movie and adding them to the blu-ray collection but in movies it works for games not so much. It's pretty much stuffing to justify the price tag. The new mode seems like assets they didn't get to use for the pvp mode and made a budget Resident Evil merc mode. This again is stuffing for the price and the other little option stuff added on to me is valued at 10 bucks. The rest of the game is like they touched up textures a tad in a quick rush and stuffed all the canceled or unfinished assets and called it a remastered give me money edition. If you buy it new it's absolutely not worth it. The fact that they talked about using unfinished levels as actual content in a game is insane. Way too soon for a remastered and only made to pat out the list of Sony games. I know it's early to say this but If this remastered shows up on the game of the year awards and it shows up on almost every category like before that seriously should tell you that you shouldn't be watching that. Oh and this game was buggy and crashed a couple of times but then again what game isn't like this since dlc and game updates ruined the industry, thanks game devs. Please avoid this game I lost 10 bucks and some change so you didn't have to. Also prepare for Actman,Gmanlives, and other YouTubers to tell you it's amazing and sell out. Act has clearly sold out his subscribers with his view on Payday 3. I'm not making money on this and I'm actually losing it buying these game I know are problems or cash grabs. Yeah I'm graceful for you reading this and please give smaller guys a chance instead of bigger ones who already look at you like your a dollar sign.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"The Last of Us Part 2 ""Remastered"" is, pound for pound, the most pointless remake/remaster in the history of video game remakes and remasters. Considering the original game is still a recent enough memory for most gamers, and with how polarizing it was, was it really a great idea to ""remaster"" this game? Aside from slightly nicer visuals, what does Part 2 ""Remastered"" really do to justify that price point? One new game mode, but another promised mode that is now cancelled. If you own this game still on PS4, then the PS5 upgrade is pointless aside from one new mode. The PS5 upgrade should have been free if you own the original game, but it isn't. Considering you can buy Last of Us Part 2 on PS4 for cheaper from legitimate retailers, both physical and digital, it makes you truly question why this ""remaster"" was made, and if it even should have happened in the first place? While I might not be too far in GOW Ragnarök, at least Santa Monica Studios had the decency to respect their fans, by making their roguelike mode a free DLC, and acting as a continuation to the story. Naughty Dog, on the other hand, charge you more for the same game (though a very slightly nicer looking one) and one new game mode. Skip this pointless ""remaster"". Even if it ends up free on PS Plus, it's not worth it if you've already played/beaten the original Last of Us Part 2. 0/10, for the pointlessness, lack of meaningful additions to this supposed ""remaster"", and for having the gall to actually charge even a penny for the same game.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"The single most overrated game ever. The story is mid, most characters are mid with a couple of exceptions, the gameplay is mindnumbingly boring, the boss fights are mostly gimicks you just need to figure out to make them trivial. Not to mention that, of course, everyone is lgbtsq or whatever. Which would be fine if literally every character wasn't forcing themselves upon you. Instead of being able to be friends with your party members, you have to suffer scene after scene of them trying to f*ck you without you ever giving them a reason to think you're up for that ****.

I disliked most characters in this game, especially ""The Emperor."" The conversations with party members were often lackluster. The romances are seriously blown out of proportion by players. The ending was awful. I don't like mindflayers whatsoever and this game does everything it can to force that crap on players. It s.u.c.k.s.

"One of the worst and most boring games I've ever played.I don't know anything about tabletop games or dungeons and dragons and I never liked turn based games. The only reason I wanted to play this game was from hearing about it so much, so much praise, and so many awards and people talking about it, how it's called one of the best games ever and how it's 96 rated on metacritic. I also played hundreds of games and I love any game that gives you freedom of choice and multiple approaches and consequences to your actions and different endings...I've played about 3 hours Baldur's Gate 3 and then I uninstalled. I'll explain why I think it's one of the worst games I've played:1- The Combat: This is the main and biggest reason why I absolutely hated the game, so you walk around freely in the game like any rpg and encounter quests and characters and chests and whatnot, but then whenever you encounter enemies the entire world literally pauses around you and it becomes a 1999 tabletop game that some nerdy kids in some basement play, it actually turns into Raid Shadow Legends lmao, it's actually hilarious that so many people like it, I guess stupidity knows no limits when it comes to the video game industry. And so it basically kills any momentum and the combat becomes this dice game where you click on an enemy and then your character attacks them and it either misses or hits, so you're not playing the game using your skills or your moves, it's just a dice game. This game is where I vowed to never ever buy or download games based on reputation and reviews, I have to watch a long playthrough in order to decide to get it or not.2- Everything All At Once: One of the other reasons why I uninstalled the game and stopped playing is because of how much convoluted stuff is in the game from the very start, like 30 different attacks or items in one character, this with 2 turns and it turns this to that for 10 turns and this attack isn't actually an attack and this move makes you hide and that move is a flame that heals and that move is some spell that turns enemies into jelly or makes them scared... It's just soooo much that I went ""what the f**k is going in, what's all of this s**t?!"". I know some games doesn't hold your hand but this is just a horrible terrible game that basically excepts you to be a Baldur's Gate player for 20 years and also have played the tabletop games, it's insanely dreadful for new players and I'm actually shocked that so many people new to the game with the IQ of 2 managed to like the game so much.3- The Story From The Start Is Not Interesting: The game starts with tentacle monsters and dragons and multiple race creatures and different worlds and so many things happening at once that I just literally lost interest from the start. The beginning **** or a in my opinion is the most important part to me, If from the start you're bored and uninteresting because of how much stuff is happening it's a bad game/movie. Games should have a clear beginning where you build up to things and slowly learn what this and that is, this game feels like you're dropped in the third act **** where you're already unlocked it all and so much story already happened, it doesn't feel like a new game that you start.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"Poor gameplay, too much sexuality in game. Optimization is poor. Definitely not recommending.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"The PR campaign and press reviews are way above actual reality. It is an overall good game which builds on the current D&D ruleset and the legacy of the previous Baldur's Gate title and general Bioware RPGs. The interface is clunky, and the combat and gameplay is sometimes too. The character faces and movements are not top notch. Woke elements are ruining the character creation to the point of being unbearable. 5 or 7 face options are given but for some reason the same amount of dangling genitalia was deemed more important. Writing of characters is sometimes very shallow, with the language depth of a pre-teen (Barbarian). Multiplayer is very enjoyable though again, junky in terms of dialogue. Totally worth playing, but nowhere close in terms of quality to what the press PR pushes it to be.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
I don’t understand the hype on this “mobile game” put on PS5! So boring to play! Only gave 2 points for the graphics. Incredible how people nowadays don’t know how to play really good games! Not fun at all! Don’t waist your time and money on this BS game!,2,PLAYSTATION 5
"Disappointing. I so badly want to like this game: I love D&D, I love RPGs where your choices have big impacts, I love games where your party has growth. But this game is a huge miss. I've reached the end of the game and I've yet to play for an hour without experiencing a bug that was at best extremely frustrating and at worst (and frequently) game breaking. The pacing is horrible. There's an immediate sense of urgency in the main quest but you're also given a huge amount of side quests immediately, some of which are time sensitive. Side treks linger on for far longer than feels natural. And then, in Act2, the game suddenly becomes incredibly linear with only two point of significant interest. It feels rushed, feels sloppy, feels like it was in ""early access"" for too **** writing is boring. It's as if someone read a few D&D rule books and said ""Yes I want to cram all of this in here.""The companions are uninspired and templated. Here is all origin companions: ""I was very powerful, but the bug in my head has me at level 1. I am a slave to XYZ, my quest is to secure my freedom from them. Along the way you can make the binary choice of me being a good guy or a bad guy.""The game gives you access to all the creative tools of D&D, but punishes out of the box solutions and forces you into a linear or binary choice which is sometimes not even hinted at. For example (keeping it vague for spoilers), there was an encounter where an NPC was trapped on a cart full of explosive oil with a flammable trail of liquid leading to him and some hostile NPCs set the liquid on fire. I threw water at the fire around the cart, it exploded and he died. Reload. I run up and help/talk to him, it exploded and he died. Reload. I quickly kill all enemies in one round, it exploded and he died. Reload. I throw water on the flammable liquid trail before the encounter starts. Fire doesn't reach him! ...until the second round where the other half of the trail randomly catches fire with no interaction from any characters. Reload. I use a telekinesis spell to move the captive NPC to safety, he randomly teleports back to the location he was in but now he's prone and hostile. Reload. Googled a solution. Apparently you have to shoot the chair he's sitting on? Are you serious? Nothing ever indicated that solution, and any of the previous solutions should have worked, but this game won't allow creative thinking. There are numerous examples of instances where you're able to withhold info from NPCs, but then they suddenly have the info as if you told them anyway because the story can't continue if they don't know it. Don't give me the option to make these choices if you don't actually have a continuation for them. Terrible planning. Near infinite glitches, bugs, and visual clipping **** UI/UX leaves a lot to be desired. Sorting your inventory is mess. Tutorial pop ups appear and cover up important info but can't be dismissed until you leave the current screen you're trying to interact with. Objective indicators often lead you in the wrong direction if you enter another area. Dye color names are sometimes misleading. Random NPCs will prevent you from looting something that should be of no concern to them or should be rightfully yours to access. The learning curve for the sloppy combat mechanics is frustrating. Dashing really confuses the games logic often throwing a ""can't reach this target"" when you in fact can, and you just need to select the area next to it first.This game is truly a mess and undeserving of the praise it receives. A real shame because it could have been a 10/10 if Larian actually put the effort into it, but I suppose the bar for GOTY is low these days and easy profit is tempting. Seriously a shame.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

"I have no idea why this game is rated so high. At least on PS5 it's really bad. And yes, I played D&D a lot when I was a student, so I understand the thing with dices and everything else. I've registered here specifically to share my opinion about this game. 1. They didn't make even an in-game calculator, so when you're trading you should count by yourself the difference in gold. 2. The thing that PS5 keyboard pops up after you choose to enter numbers makes me crazy. 3. Those ""circles"" with spells and abilities are inconvenient, especially because you can't delete some of them even if they are empty. 4. When you drop your weapons after the enemy's ability, you need to set up the ""circles"" again, because the game doesn't save where the ability was before. That's annoying. 5. I played the game in January 2024, and there are still plenty of bugs. With major ones, like I was in a tower at the start of Act 3, and couldn't jump off on a lower level because the camera didn't allow me to pick the needed angle. Or when the cursor was stuck to the character up to 5-7 seconds after I picked the ability, that happened to me 1 out of 25-30 times, so pretty often considering that the game is based on this mechanic. And many more bugs including visual ones. 6. The major storyline starts with nothing and ends with nothing. So, because this game gives you many opportunities to choose and those choices impact the progress doesn't make it SO GOOD like many described.",3,PLAYSTATION 5
"Combat, in particular, is a major letdown. While previous entries in the series offered engaging real-time battles that required quick thinking and strategic planning, Baldur's Gate 3 opts for a turn-based system that feels sluggish and cumbersome.

This shift away from real-time action robs the game of the excitement and intensity that defined its predecessors.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

I'm seeing the same problem here, with Overwatch 2. The Game doesn't show you, nor tell you anything. This loses the ""fun"" part of the game. I was lost many times, and because of this bad map design, I was walking around the map clueless. The Game is full of gore, and pornographic scenes... This is why people in the 80' said that Dungeons & Dragons is bad for the children. And this is why the game is famous. This game robbed Alan Wake 2 from the Game Of The Year Award. Alan Wake 2 is this years, best game. A game with a dark tone, with beautiful graphics, and with a brilliant narrative. And with 0 pornographic scenes! This Game, Baldur's Gate 3 is an over hyped Ren'Py Visual Novel Game. Do me a favour, and play Alan Wake 2, and see what this ""game"" robbed.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"With the reviews, I thought 'no matter this type of game isn't my thing, it seems to be for everyone!'. Dear lord, no! I'm not cool by any means but lordy, this is top tier nerdy stuff. Also, VERY time consuming....expect to spend hours and still be pretty much where you were when you first logged in that day. I think with some insane level of actually caring about what's going on and the results of your actions, it is maybe good? I couldn't give a monkeys and so I just tried to plough through **** even then it all took ages. No idea why the big love but if you hated it like me, you're not alone! Hope that makes you feel a tad better about wasting your hard earned money.",3,PLAYSTATION 5
"I really tried to try a new game. This game seemed to be loved by a particular niche. Having paid full price off the hype I’d recommend against playing it. Just watch it online if you want the story. Cause the gameplay **** for me and is so convoluted and confusing. The movement is extremely slow throughout the map which was a problem for me even in Pokémon and other similar games but the story makes up for it. I’m also pissed cause a glitch cost me a weapon I spent so long to find and my squad was weaker in every single fight after. I liked the story so far but it all seems consequential. If you’re into this type of game or DnD you’ll love it. For me, I got to the end of act 2 and put it down I hate this game. It frustrated me throughout and the story feels inconsequential. This game gets overwhelming positivity for some reason idk. For me, it **** ****. For someone else, this might be the best game ever cause they enjoy these type of things. Also it’s very easy to make fake metacritic accounrs and bot spam boost reviews. I’m not saying that they’re doing that just that it is. Keep that in mind before you buy off the hype. For reference I enjoyed cyberpunk more. Even Jedi survivor. Its just not my thing and the grind and main fun parts of the game **** to me. It seems like a pointless investment of mashing buttons that makes me question life. All while letting 90% of the story bore me. In the end I tried out a game randomly and I hated it but I loved the Witcher 3 when I did that. So whatever do you",1,PLAYSTATION 5

"How the hell did this buggy PoS win Game of the Year? And also win COMMUNITY SUPPORT!? After several huge patches that make this game take over 100 Gb of storage space, there are still a plethora of bugs that lock you out of content. It was a really slimy tactic for Larian to only allow you to play Act 1 during early access and give the false sense of a completed and functioning game. I have dumped over 200 hours into this game, most of which creating new characters and playing through Act 1 several times until I found the right character to see the story through. However, Act 2 and beyond are buggy messes that lock you out of content you paid full price for. The best metaphor I can think of to describe this is that you take a turd, polish it, spray with cologne, wrap it in gold, so it loses the same of a turd, but when you open it you are still left with a pile of SH**. Never buying another game from Larian so I can waste time more time on something so buggy it **** any fun or potential it had. So TLDR if you are fine with paying full price for the shiny wrapper of a turd, go ahead and throw your money on this dumpster fire.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is a buggy, inexplicable game that throws a fresh hell at you every single time you figure you’ve got the patterns down. If the constant crashes, annoying characters, maps and quests that don’t actually give you enough to go on without continually referencing walkthroughs don’t send you into flames of fury every five seconds, the fact that it’s a hardline DnD game - to the point where I feel like I meed a player’s manual - will. If that were all, I’d rate it slightly higher- maybe mediocre - but even the super-duper 5th edition hardline is actually crippled compared to a pen and paper session. It is tedious, slow, annoying trash that somehow evokes enough fun to get a 2/10. But for the love of all that is holy, don’t expect it to be a fun throwback. This is similar to BG and BG2 in the same way that getting hit in the head with a rock is like having an enjoyable ride on a bicycle.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

"Buggiest game I have played in decades. As it stands I'm stuck in act 3 because a major quest is bugged. The developers say they are aware of the bug yet they released this game nonetheless. These are not isolated bugs either, I've seen thousands of reports of this, and there are thousands more bugs that they still haven't been able to isolate and correct. Pretty lousy form Larian. I won't trust you again that's for sure. Don't waste your money or your valuable time on this rushed, buggy crap.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"I'm not finished with you Larian. My son bought this game on PS5, so that entitles me to review this game one more time. These game journalists and toy-collecting introverted millennials (who are ironically the most vocal on the internet) won't say anything bad about this game, so what I'm about to say needs be addressed. ""Enjoy the game to its fullest without any additional costs or microtransactions"" is that so? Then why does the PS5 version cost $70? The greedy developers are charging an extra $10 to PS5 owners for absolutely no reason. Technically those $10 are additional costs, meaning that Larian lied. If Larian was the ""consumer friendly"" company that everyone made them out to be, then why did they join the greedy trend of charging $10 extra for the PS5 version? This is EA behavior right here. ● This is a low quality buggy game for $70. In spite of that, it gets highly praised by critics and the ""story made me cry GOTY"" millennials. If Skyrim, Witcher 3, and now this garbage is anything to go by, it's pretty obvious that fantasy RPGs get a pass for low quality buggy trash lacking in detail. If it were anything else (especially COD and Ubisoft), these same people wouldn't shut up about it. These type of gamers are never consistent. Let's be honest, this is a $70 mobile game. Now I didn't even want to talk about the wokeness in this game, because literally every AAA game this decade is woke. But I'm getting real sick and tired of these conservative gamers ignoring the obvious wokeness of any game/studio that's an internet darling. They unironically think games like Fallout are anti-woke. I know you anti-woke millennials want to live in your little fantasy world where the best entertainment was made by conservatives, but you have to accept reality. Most game developers are liberals. ● The multiplayer is trash. What do so many games with microtransactions have in common? Most of them as far as I'm aware have a PvP mode. Does this have PvP? Yeah, I didn't think so. I don't ever want to see developers bragging about lack of MTX in their games if it doesn't have online PvP. If you're not greedy and lazy Larian, prove it. Give me a PvP mode. It shouldn't be too hard when so many low budget games have PvP. But let's face it, you won't do it because you know I'm right. And if you do add PvP, I bet you will go against your MTX beliefs. This is a generic RPG mobile game, yet we have developers pretending this is an anomaly in a pathetic attempt to trick gamers into believing this is high quality to decrease workload. No it isn't. A game like GTA V for instance is an anomaly, which is why GTA VI is easily the most anticipated game right now. I don't recommend this game at all. ● P.S. Metacritic, quit deleting reviews you don't agree with. Larian literally lied about no additional costs for BG3. An extra $10 for PS5 owners is an additional cost. That's not even my opinion, it's a fact. Despite the lies being in front of everyone's face, no one is going to acknowledge it, so my review deserves to stay up. If this were COD or sports games, you would've let it slide. This game is just as woke, cringe, broken, and low quality as Saints Row. If the latter is hated, why does this game get a pass? Learn to accept different opinions Metacritic.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"‘If you’re a fan of RPGs, then you need to try this game’ is the biggest lie that costed me $105AUD and now I can’t refund..

A masterpiece **** where the graphics are tremendous and gameplay is investing and brings you in for the long haul. Rarely will you stumble upon glitches or bugs, or anything game breaking. On PS5 however, it will constantly freeze in battles, framerates drop in larger battles [which are everywhere like the Goblin fortress], and the system runs hot during these times. Really hot. I'd recommend making sure you have proper ventilation. Outside that the story is the same obviously. Gameplay is the same but slower on console.

Seems kind of a cheap way to try and blow up in popularity. People will say they just don't engage with it but everyone knows they're lying. It's such a shame that this is being considered as game of the year by mostly porn addicts. Something like this should be rated AO and not be allowed to be streamed on Twitch since there might be children watching.

But now it's 2023 and everyone takes gaming more seriously than religion and bunch of different people are overhyping this game for different reasons. There are diablo fans (haters), there are those who forgot that Final Fantasy hasn't been turn based for 20 years and want new games to be turn based and then there are those who like to go along with hypetrain, without even caring if the game is actually any good.

"This is tough to write because honestly, Act 1 and 2 make this game THE Game of the Year. Heck, I was ready to put it in my top 5 all time favorite games. I have 100+ hours in this game now and just loved the story and choices and the combat. And then Act 3 happened. I started having performance issues, I started having weird glitches were my companions would lose half their bodies and couldn't fight anymore, I've had 5 different quests completely bug out on me and even a main quest bug out that I can't even complete. Not only that, but the story choices of what is going on - the main bad guys and fights aren't as thought out as things were in the first 2 acts. It is very clear that Act 3 was completely rushed in my opinion to get the release out the door and does not have the same care that Acts 1 and 2 had. All of that enjoyment of Acts 1 and 2 to just come up against the frustrations in Act 3 killed my enthusiasm for this game. I know Larian will likely fix these issues as I suspect as more people start finishing the game they will see/hear this criticism - and quite possibly they already know this. But I can't in good faith recommend someone spend 80+ hours in a game and then just run up against game breaking bugs that won't allow them to finish the game they way they want to.

AI is braindead. You either get swarmed by tens of enemies that take turns in hitting you or you go kill enemies one by one or enemies that are a little bit further away have no idea you just killed like five of their men. They are so unaware of your presence that you dont even have to use stealth. Enemies are deaf. Their comrades yelling in pain and shooting from bows but they are unable to hear it and go help. even tho theyre like 10-20 meters away from a fight. A lot of scripted stuff and poor balancing.

"It's pretty to look at, and if you are really into Samurai stories/cinema you may enjoy this game for the experience of fighting like a samurai. Not being a hug fan of the genre, I found it very difficult to relate to the characters, and they definitely were not likable in my opinion. I didn't feel invested in the story and found it difficult to justify playing. The abilities that you get as you progress will slightly mix up your play style and the feel of the game but not enough. Enemies are almost exclusively mundane humans which is okay when you don't have a point of comparison. However, if you've played God of War, Demons Souls, The Last of Us, Returnal, or even Horizon Zero Dawn (all games with enemies and abilities that draw on supernatural sources of inspiration) then the enemies in this game will be quite bland by comparison. I may return to this game once I've exhausted all the other amazing and free games in the Play Station collection, but until then this purchase is nothing more than a regret now collecting dust in my game library.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

The game is exactly the same as the original except that it has an update of graphics and takes advantage of the new mechanics that PS5 control offers.I think it was a very Avara move by Sony for a Next Gen patch when all studies are offering those patches completely free as Square Enix did with FF7 and the DLC offered it as an option and not sell it next to the patch.Sony really abuses us their fans but as long as we continue to justify them they will continue to make this type of movements without mentioning the rise in the prices of their exclusive games.,1,PLAYSTATION 5

The upgrade path is so ridiculous and people are rightfully angry about it. Iki island expansion is still great and there is some good content here. APart from some minor crashes it's totally worth $20. What's bad is the extra $10 you have to pay just to unlock basic PS5 features which are promised for all PS5 games. I have no objections to pay for next gen enhancements when they are done right. Metro exodus, Miles Morales, FF7R, Star wars Jedi Fallen Order, Doom Eternal, A Plague's Tale and lot other games got next gen enhancements which significantly improved visual quality using next gen lighting, shadows etc, supporting Dualsense features and these are all given for free. Though GoT on PS4 looks great, I hoped for some changes in lighting, textures, shadows and draw distance as it's not a free next gen upgrade.

"The game is fundamentally a good RPG but not a good God of War. To me it has little in common with what makes a God of War game truly special. Colorful, fairy-tale-like worlds, a lack of gore and a toned-down Kratos just aren’t fun. Most of the boss fights were pretty mid. I also don’t like Atreus and the story in general. I really miss God of War 3 especially the old combat system. God of War Ragnarök is fine if you’re looking for an RPG but if you want a real God of War experience like in the old days stay away. A lot of the bosses from the side content are also completely over the top in terms of difficulty and balancing. You definitely don’t feel like the powerful Kratos from the old games anymore. Going for the platinum trophy wasn’t all that fun either.",6,PLAYSTATION 5
Excellent game in every way graphically and technically impeccable Gamplay Pleasant Ost and quality dubbing good lifespan and interesting scenario,10,PLAYSTATION 5
I have been a massive fan of the God of War franchise playing almost every single game that Santa Monica Studio made only two games I have never play. Playing the playstation handheld and console version both the playstation 3 to playstation 5. Am just going to put on the table this is some of the best efforts I have seen from the developer of Santa Monica Studio every aspect of the game is just perfect the only problem is finding the problem with this game. Let's start with the story between Kratos and Atreus also known as Loki. I have never seen such a perfect story so well written the story of a man trying to put his past behind him trying to move forward and be a father again doing things right without violence is such a well put story. Pacing is bit inconsistent during some part of Angrboda sections is a bit drag out and cringe sometime maybe not for some but I find myself disliking Angrboda due to the fact that she is not really that likeable in my opinion and during some part of the sections its drag for too long and only some part is important like finding out the prophesy of kratos and having a deeper connection with Atreus. The story and how the game is serving it to you is just a masterpiece. I love that you get to play as Atreus sometimes and even get to partner up with different people throughout your journey. And you even get to pair up with Thor it's so awesome and fun. The music and song is just so well suited and I love love Bear McCreary for creating such a well put song. the direction that Santa Monica studio is going for this franchise is so well put from a man of revenge and anger that fuel his anger to kill those who wrong him and stand in his way to a father that is trying to put is life behind him and try to be a normal person Is such a well put innovative thinking but of course with the game that is this perfect in nearly every aspect of the game comes with flaws with is very hard to find and pin point down. The pacing is a bit inconsistent at the middle of the game and also the difficulty I found was not really that hard even though I play on god of war difficulty which is the hardest but it could be higher to tune for player who really wants the challenge. Enemy design and world map is very well detailed and bugs were never an issue and barely any bugs. Now with the rating am giving a 9 out of 10 a must play badge. By MarshMallow,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"A true successor. Great story, brutal gameplay, awesome graphics. Perfect in each aspect.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarök proves that Santa Monica Studio is not only capable of continuing the legacy of this iconic franchise, but elevating it to even greater heights. This sequel delivers a breathtaking cinematic experience, paired with refined gameplay and a rare emotional depth for an action **** evolution of the characters—especially the complex relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus—brings maturity and humanity to the story. Combat remains brutal and satisfying, with expanded tactical variety. The world design is incredibly detailed, and the epic score amplifies every moment.While a few segments feel slightly drawn out, the journey is well worth every minute. Ragnarök isn’t just a follow-up—it’s a peak moment in a series that redefined the action-adventure genre.Pros:Mature, emotionally resonant storyDeep, satisfying combat mechanicsStunning visuals and world-buildingRichly developed charactersCons:Some side quests feel repetitiveNarrative pacing slows down occasionallyVerdict:God of War: Ragnarök stands as one of the best games of this generation, and a fitting conclusion to Kratos’ Norse saga",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Ragnarok is at least as good **** as GoW 2018. I put over 50 hours into this game and actually enjoyed doing as many side quests as possible because they were actually fun. The level design, puzzles and objectives were great. The graphics are excellent. The game feels good to play on the DualSense controller and the controls are very smooth. Walking and combat feels satisfying. The combat is very fun and doesn't feel grindy. The story is pretty good, though I didn't entirely comprehend it all. At times, the game felt more like a movie than a game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I really like the character Brok. The reviewers complaining about the game being woke are ridiculous, probably because there are a couple of black characters. Are they not allowed to be in video games?? Anyway, if there are any flaws about this game, I would say that the RPG elements, equipment menus and vast array of attacks and abilities can be a bit much to fully understand. There are numerous attack combos that you can unlock, but I only used a handful of attacks throughout the whole game because I can't remember 30+ different attacks which require various button combos. But again, you can progress just fine by sticking to a few favorite attacks. The game is not difficult, but just right, in my experience. I did think the voice acting was a bit cringey for certain characters. I am not really a fan of Atreus, to be honest. But at the end of the day, the game has a lot to offer in terms of exploration, side quests, fun, equipment and ability upgrades.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"What an honor to play a game that good by our times, i liked the first one and liked this one on the same scale, not one above the other, only two perfect games in my opinion. tysm Cory Barlog and all the team behind this masterpiece.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Great game, but a step down from God of War (2018). The sound design and voice acting are excellent, and the storytelling is strong — though the plot twists are predictable and lack excitement. Visually, the graphics and animations are solid, but there are some dated and rough-looking elements, like low-quality distant objects and even nearby textures, such as certain rocks. Lighting can be surprisingly poor at times, giving the game an outdated look. Most realms feel visually similar and lack distinctiveness, with some questionable design choices. The extended Atreus sections drag on and feel tedious. Combat is generally fun, but can become chaotic and occasionally unresponsive, especially when dodging. The lock-on camera is more frustrating than helpful. Progression feels somewhat unbalanced. Upgrading armor is harder than it should be, and weapons feel underpowered. Nearing the final story mission with 90% of the world explored, I still can't upgrade any armor past level 7 or my weapons beyond level 6–7. There’s also a sense of padding — the 12 berserker fights, for example, felt more exhausting than rewarding. Overall, while Ragnarok is a very good game, it doesn’t reach the impact and variety of its predecessor. God of War (2018) was a truly memorable experience, Ragnarok just doesn’t hit the same heights.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"played it in 2025, great franchise ,brutal fights in normal mode difficulty, really enjoyed it story telling was fantastic ,one complain for me was fight after fight windows was so short to breath lol, but overall great game you need to play this its awesome and you will satisfied 100%",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"Probabilmente il miglior GoW mai uscito: mondo vasto, dettagliato e pieno di vita, combattimento sempre al limite e la caratterizzazione di alcuni **** (Thor e Odino su tutti) è magistrale.

"Game Review – A Masterpiece of Combat, Storytelling, and Character DevelopmentThis game delivers an outstanding experience, building on the intense and immersive combat mechanics that fans loved in the previous installment — now refined and expanded for even greater impact. The gameplay feels fluid and dynamic, offering a satisfying challenge through both mini-bosses and epic main-boss battles that are smartly distributed throughout the journey. What truly sets this game apart is its emotional depth and storytelling. The narrative is packed with dramatic, emotional, and epic moments, alongside unexpected twists that keep players fully engaged. The character development is remarkably well-crafted, with relationships evolving meaningfully over time, adding emotional weight to the journey. Equally impressive is the writing and design of the antagonists, particularly Thor and Odin. These characters are not just obstacles — they are complex, well-written figures who enrich the story with moral ambiguity and psychological depth. In conclusion, this game masterfully blends gameplay, story, and character development into a truly unforgettable experience. It stands as one of the finest games ever made — if not the finest — and sets a new benchmark for action-adventure storytelling.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I don't even want to waste letters on objective criticism of this game. I'll just say that God of War: Ragnarok was anything but the God of War; Grandfather of War, Angrbol of War, Atreus of War, Strangler of War! God of War: Ragnarok is the official funeral of the series.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

Great game with stunning visuals and good mechanics. But they had to include people of color in a greek mythology. This was not very fitting and was a forced decision.,7,PLAYSTATION 5
"I've been thinking about playing this game for a long time. Having grown up on PS2 as a child and PS3 as a teenager, Kratos is one of my favorite anti-heroes of all time. However, after the very good God of War from 2018, I was wondering what to do with Ragnarok. I kept my distance mainly because one of the most useless consulting companies in the world participated in the game. Company, which always destroys everything it touches... However, a few days ago, since it's in PS Plus, my girlfriend pushed me to download Ragnarok. And I have to admit that I really didn't expect such a great experience! The influence of the most useless company in the world is obvious, but fortunately minimal. And now to the game itself: 120% for me, no debate! The gameplay, graphics, and even the story are just awesome! I also like Kratos's change of approach to both Atreus and his entire past. It's a very natural progression that can be fully understood and accepted after his life experiences. I want to highlight one more thing: I've always found it annoying in games after finishing the main story that when completing unfinished sidequests in the world, the characters in the game become speechless and soulless. I was very pleased that Mimir, Freya, Kratos and others remained communicative and natural after the main story ends. It helps maintain the atmosphere and keep player's motivation to complete each of the realms on 100%! And yeah, I just started the Valhalla DLC and the enthusiasm continues. I thank all the real developers from the bottom of my heart for bringing such a mega-super experience, although I know it must be very difficult to work under the leadership of spoiled narcissistic Western managers who no longer know what else they could ideologically ruin from goodness.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War is the second game after the game style remodeling.Beautiful graphics, to be expected of a large studio that is Santa Monica but this is simply the worst gow for the following reasons: 1-The game is long and full of unnecessary parts to increase the hours of the game as in the parts of Atreus, or Freya.2-The game has only 3 enemies, Odin, Thor and Eimdal, the rest of them are NPCs with life that covers every screen.3-The puzzles are always the same, from beginning to end.4-Inflames with each door crossed or Puzzle resolved and this made the game very repetitive and boring.Compared to the ancient Gow, this immense failure taking the essence of the game by turning it into a God of God of war.",3,PLAYSTATION 5

Just awesome man. Keep it up devs!,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Someway, somehow, they managed to keep this one as good as the previous one, and even made it better. Such an emotional story, and such epic battles! This is now my favorite game of all time. Sadly theydid come race swapping, which is never thought Santa monica would do. But yeah SBI really infected the industry there. In any case, they didnt mess it up too much. The pros outweigh the cons. But I would love to see an actual white faced red headed angrboda, and a non Indian dude as freyas brother .",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War: Ragnarok is almost a great game. Interesting story, fun level design, good combat, fantastic bosses, excellent voice acting, decent pacing, great graphics, good sound design, good sound track... So why 6/10? This is a case where the sum is lesser than it's parts. Weak links in game design drag down what could be a fantastic game. Uninteresting objectives - the gameplay means less when you aren't interested in the outcome or the outcome is underwhelming. Poorly coordinated combat encounters - good combat system and controls mean little when the encounters are not well thought out. Meaningless exploration - the rewards for time spent searching make you feel like you should not be exploring in the first place. Inconsistent pacing - adrenaline filled boss fight to walking simulator. I'll add that I found the dialog lazy compared to the first game. This game continues the trend of gamers largely en masse accepting below average as masterclass. I'm not sure if my gaming peers are children with different ideas of what a good game can be or if they have underdeveloped/differing opinions but I cannot agree with the acclaim this game has received. I did not finish the game (I did 100% God of War, that game was overall much more enjoyable from the standpoints of my criticisms outlined in this review) and I would not recommend Ragnarok to the busy adult gamer who should spend their time and money on a higher quality product.",6,PLAYSTATION 5
The first was a game and this does not disappoint.At a narrative level few things reach their level and is a perfect closure to the Nordic saga.Playably it is quite continuous but little more could be improved in gameplay. It is obviously an indispensable pass of Sony,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Amazing level of production and the mechanics are fun, but it REALLY overstay its welcome. Its fun at the start but about 1/3 of the game, everything becomes too formulaic: killing enemies, climb walls, open chests, solving the same kind of puzzles and lots of narrative context (and boring) segments. That's pretty much what we have to do for about 30 hours. Also, no epic battles like the old days and most of the characters are kinda bland. 94 score on MC is a joke.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War Ragnarok-70/100 Here, probably, the most controversial impression comes out for me: it is impossible to jump over or break a small fence to get to the task or take something, what surgery because of this game convention .. But it was identical and in the last part, it was just more here, or something.Like an identical dull balance of hardcore, which I hate.They did not decide to correct this at all.The flower corn was sometimes straight out of the vigilant.Of course, the kratos has to swim, not what was in the previous part (this is a direct exception, but it is very strange to see when some gameplay scenes are masterpiece in appearance).The worlds here are very beautiful because of light and detail, the shadows are good, but in some colorful places it is very strange with light things are: either everything is very pale, then unrealistically contrasting.More than half of the skills that re-open, you just need to ... A bunch of ases and animations were taken simply from the last part, something was a little improved, something on the contrary (the interface did not really like it, in the last part I was clearer and more pleasant to dig in it), something was not touched at all.I understand why many of the game attribute the status of DLC, although I do not think so.The puzzle is larger, and they are better - not complex and not simple.How stuffy moments are there in the game is tin.I understand that the game changed the vector, the emphasis on the plot and the narrative, that I liked it in the 4th part in the 4th part, but how much is it.And the battles with enemies are more, of course, the game as a whole is much more, as finally, the variety of enemies.And, oh god, a bunch of bosses are different (albeit again repeating).But what did not like in them, so that in these battles there is not enough entertainment, there is not enough cruelty with bosses (with mobs), as in the good old three.Well, too much the game became Susyukana and the nursery: Atrea collects pears for 2 hours .. Yes, at that moment the plot is revealed, but this could be done much more interesting than the gameplay.Having passed the game, there was some very twofold impression, and rather the advantage will be more significant towards what I did not like.The plot and spoilers are just some kind of illogical and strange muvas that turns in the plot.To make a way to Ragnarek, to call it in order to then try to stop it (and not even personally, but to Singlely ...) - this is so stupid, and such disappointment caused.Anyway, the feeling that 60 percent of the plot and gameplay is to walk, look for prophecies, which are essentially not interesting.Not a supply to them, not the prophecies themselves.The game in some points is too stretched, and stretch uninteresting.In this part, I began to understand the characters less.For me, some of them acted or said not as they showed them.The characters seemed to be not empty, but even less worked out than in the past.A brief result: expectations were overestimated, even rather, others were in some cases.It surpasses the previous part in everything, but, probably, it is still subjective, but much more I liked the 2018 game in the plot plan.In this tears, goosebumps from action, I experienced almost nothing, just negative from protractedness and uninteresting missions.Well, there are still a lot of minuses that can be listed and which are simply forgotten.I knocked out platinum.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"After getting the platinum on the first game, I thought this one would be weaker since I already found the first one exceptional. But they took every aspect of the game to an unimaginable level.

Role playing elements like skills and gear are not interesting enough. Graphics are average at most. Feels like they didn't even put that PS5 into a test, also no haptics.

"There are less than 30 boss fights in a very long game, and fighting some of the boss fights is not at all interesting and my time was wasted. The game play is not fast and interesting, and Kratos should fight much faster, it should be clear from his fighting skills that he is the strongest and unrivaled, and not by looking at the past of the character he had. But Kratos moves his sword and axe slowly. Some stages of the game are very boring and make the game less worth repeating or not worth repeating the game again, and even finishing the game for the first time is not so enjoyable that you can enjoy the game for hours. The presence of puzzles or intellectual stages did not give me any pleasure and it was just a waste of time for me to finish it quickly.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

Masterpiece..with some flaws here and there.. But all and **** just å peak videogame,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"A funny thing happened while playing this top tier AAA game: I stopped having fun. The main culprit is the “Soulsification” of gameplay and its emphasis on difficulty that just shuts out older and slow players or players who are stressed for time who just don’t care about getting good. The gameplay itself is the problem with this game. The main issue is the parry mechanic. You can no longer simply block with a shield. Every block has to be perfectly timed with an enemy attack. Time it wrong and you are worse off than not blocking. The accessibility options will let you tweak enemy damage but not increase the parry window. A longer reaction window would also help with attacks that can’t be blocked and attacks that must be counter attacked with a shield attack. The first God of War game came out in 2005. It’s long overdue for this franchise make their games accessible to an aging player base. A minor enemy of fun in this game is the repeated backtracking to already explored areas for minor fetch quests. This is not an open world game and traversal is not fun. Some of the puzzles were not that fun either. I can see why folks like the climb anywhere mechanic in the latest Zelda games. That‘s enough negativity. The world, story, dialogue, and voice acting in this game are the best around. When people say they want single player games, they mean story telling and world building like this. You could take away all the combat and turn God of War into a story based game like “Detroit: Become Human”, and players would still love it. So all-in-all, I recommend this game with caveats. If you are a novice gamer or older gamer like myself, you might struggle to enjoy this game. With some tweaking, this could be a perfect 10/10 game. Right now, it just isn’t.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War: Ragnarok is a masterful sequel that builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, delivering an epic and emotionally charged journey. Developed by Santa Monica Studio, the game continues the story of Kratos and Atreus as they navigate the challenges of Norse mythology and the impending doom of **** narrative is one of the game's strongest aspects, weaving a tale of family, destiny, and redemption. The relationship between Kratos and Atreus evolves beautifully, showcasing moments of tension, growth, and heartfelt connection. The writing is complemented by stellar voice acting and a breathtaking soundtrack that enhances the emotional depth of the story.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"And this great adventure ends.Full of exciting moments, seeing how these incredible characters evolve, with excellent battles and everything Gow 2018 gave us but improved.Again we are facing a more serene and reflective Kratos, dealing with being a good father but finding a draft that is now much more rebellious and determined.This Bastabte improvement compared to the previous one, the fights are faster, with some novelties but quite recycling.The Boss Fight are incredible but for me they are still a more forgettable pelin than those of Greek mythology, the story is wonderfully narrated but here is where a problem is presented for me, the rhythm.You come to the stick and from one moment to the other fall from fifth to first.And for me the other problem is that the game always takes you hand in hand, either with scalable walls painted or with your allies almost immediately telling you.It is at the height of 2018 but it would put a step down because the surprise effect is zero, everything was known before.Even so and everything I will not deny that it is a must play within the Steam and PS5 catalog.Beautiful closure of nordic mythology, with happy moment and others very sad.A bitter taste and a ragnarok from which I expected more.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"I felt i didint reach the level of epicness from the first entry, even with the cast of characters that where heavely anticipated at the end of the first game.

"This game is, unfortunately, held back by a dragged out story and forced DEI characters. Sadly, I didn't realize Sweet Baby Inc was part of the story until it had unnecessary characters doing absurd mandatory tasks like collecting tree root and apples. It's extremely distracting and detracts from the game overall. Otherwise, the gameplay, graphics, and fighting mechanics are high quality if you can look past the short comings.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"This game sure has its flaws, the story slows down the gameplay a lot, Atreus' levels are particulary boring and slow, and the final conflict is very underwhelming and anticlimatic. But The side content is just... Godly, I had more fun doing side quests and fighting challenging optional bosses than I had for most of the story, (there are some great story bosses though) the maps are much bigger than God of war 2018, the combat is deeper and better, parrying attacks feels so satisfying. it is nearly perfect action game, dragged down by its story.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War Ragnarok: A Masterpiece of Storytelling, Combat, and Character Growth After completing God of War Ragnarok and its Valhalla DLC, I can confidently say that this game exceeded my expectations in every way. From the intense boss battles to the breathtaking animation and deeply emotional storytelling, Santa Monica Studio delivered an unforgettable experience that solidifies Kratos’ legacy. Combat & Boss Battles The battles in God of War Ragnarok are nothing short of epic. Every encounter feels weighty, tactical, and rewarding. Facing gods, beasts, and legendary warriors kept me engaged from start to finish. From the brutal confrontations with Thor and Odin to the shocking returns of Magni and Modi in Valhalla, every fight is designed to push Kratos to his limits. The DLC adds even more depth by making Kratos confront not just enemies, but his past self, leading to some of the most meaningful duels in the series. Animation & Visuals Visually, this game is a masterpiece. The level of detail in the environments, from the icy peaks of Midgard to the fiery ruins of Muspelheim, is breathtaking. Every animation—from Kratos’ brutal combat executions to Atreus’ swift archery—feels fluid and cinematic. Playing on PC via Steam, I was able to experience God of War Ragnarok in stunning high resolution, making every moment feel even more immersive. Story & Character Development What sets Ragnarok apart is its powerful storytelling. Kratos’ journey is no longer just about survival and vengeance—it’s about legacy, redemption, and change. Seeing Kratos evolve from the Ghost of Sparta into a leader and father figure willing to guide others was one of the most compelling aspects of the game. Atreus also grows significantly, forging his own path while still staying connected to his father. The introduction of new characters and the return of familiar ones, such as Sigrun and the Shield Maidens, enriches the world-building and lore. Final Thoughts God of War Ragnarok is more than just a game—it’s an experience. The seamless combination of action, mythology, and emotional storytelling makes it one of the greatest titles of this generation. With the Valhalla DLC, we get an even deeper dive into Kratos’ past, testing his resolve and forcing him to face the ghosts that still haunt him. If you haven’t played God of War Ragnarok, now is the time. And if you’ve already experienced it, let’s discuss! What were your favorite moments? What do you think is next for Kratos?

"This is a game that is hard to review. Objectively it is not a bad game, graphics, gameplay and story are decent, but I cannot say I enjoyed it. The most annoying thing is that you play a god of war but you don’t feel like a god of war, just an old man with an axe. A god of war that gets killed after receiving 3-4 hits by a common raider? On normal difficulty. You’re kidding me.. I died so many times it became a joke. In Forspoken I felt much more like a god(ess) of war than here. Also the characters sometime talk too much, the dialogues are not particularly interesting or funny, and overall it’s the same thing over and over, very similar to previous games. If you have played the previous god of war, or games like tomb raider, uncharted, etc, you have seen it all. It’s ok if you like this type of game, but nothing stand out too much.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War: Ragnarök is a continuous epic of God of War 2018, built on the same engine and carries on the great story of the first game... However, it's not as good in terms of Story as the first game. Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 8.5/10 Graphics: 9/10 Enjoyment: 9/10 Music: 9.5/10 Overall: 9/10 God of War: Ragnarök once again shines through with its outstanding combat, with fluid animations and finishers, it puts it above all other action games. Combine that with good world-building and storytelling, and you have an imposing cinematic action game. The puzzles are done much better in Ragnarök, they built upon the good mechanics they had in the base God of War and made the puzzles very intriguing and fun to complete. They also added more side content compared to the first game, which already had a lot. The music and themes of the characters are done to perfection. I have a few criticisms about the story. First, the voice actor for one character I cannot mention is not great, and it really does not match his character, but instead sounds like a pre-pubescent. The cartoon villainy of some other characters is not compelling whatsoever. There are obvious and quite literally the most unneeded decisions that had nothing to add to the story. Sweet Baby Inc. worked with them near the end of Ragnarok, and it shows. And I don't know if the character development of Kratos is something I like, but we'll see how it pans out in future games. There is something about the old-timeliness of a story, Black Myth Wukong excelled at this because it's based off a mythos from the 15th century, as too is Ragnarök which is based on an even older story from the 10th century, they did not bother to follow it, which is fine since they are bringing Kratos in, but I feel not taking from these classics does a disservice. God of War: Ragnarök feels like a modern Avengers film and doesn't have classical touch games like God of War 2016 and Wukong did. The 2018 game was amazing, but this one is a mish mash of ideas executed inadequately with much less direction. And this shouldn't surprise anyone, because they were considering making Ragnarök into two games instead of one final game for the Norse series.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

It’s like they think gamers want their game replaced by a cheesy movie where the game aspect is just a miniature side dish (and a putrid one at **** the story line utilises emotional manipulation and disguises it as depth. I know even if these creatively bankrupt clowns tried to add a game aspect into their “game” it would just more of this boring “gameplay”. Uncharted 4 was an example of a liniar game done right but even that game was 80% carried by the story side but if your story is a uninspired **** like Ragnarok over here AND the gameplay **** you’re left with another generic ass triple A playstation exclusive that needs serious astroturfing from paid off game critics.",0,PLAYSTATION 5

"Impressive and emotional, but I leave a lot to be desired.God of War (2018) I leave the rod very high and Ragnarok should have been the second game of a trilogy, not the last game of this.The gameplay was greatly improved with respect to the first, scenarios, mechanics, visual and narrative section but the very hurried end, in addition to the fact that many questions were left in the air without answering in addition to some parts that did not contribute anything to history, it could have been a masterpiece",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game would be better if you don't have kratos, it doesn't match this game, all mechanical and light design choices leave Kratos looking weak and slow, ordinary enemies need a lot of hit to die, even there are a lot of iguanas to kill, which makes it seem that kratos is a weakness, comparing with the old ones that it was easily enemy, here you see it.Kratos sweating to maintain small and crude enemies, is definitely a game that has Kratos just to sell, but nothing of the essence of the character",0,PLAYSTATION 5
Enjoyed the game story most of everything that had to offer but found the side quests super boring. Also the gameplay was more complicated than the previous game. If you cannot memorize lots of combos in the controller then you will have to change the difficulty to easy. That's what i did to manage the game difficulty.,7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Well, if you want a god of war game, with a lot of testosterone and good hacking and smashing things. this is not the game for you.

"February 2025 - Platinum - I want God of War had played before, I did only the main one, but now I will play to platinum.The exploration gameplay was much more dynamic, improving the locomotion of the game.I like to have a greater interaction with the scenario and can freeze water and light some torches, even if they are only selected.It takes a long time to get magic attack runes and the former are very bland.In this game the ax is much better than the blades.There are much more enemies in this game.This game is much easier than the previous one, but the secondary enemies are much more difficult.In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed having more supportive companions with them using different blows.History is the weakest point of this game.Everyone is in a depressive vibe, asking for forgiveness for everything.Kratos on a way of not wanting war.Atreus is much more boring.Kratos seems to be an extra in the game, the only time it makes the story walk is when it goes after the fate sisters and will make the spear, the rest he's there as his back guard of the Atreus and Freya.I really liked huhdall, I thought it was a lot of fun to divert the blows, he could have hit a little more at the head.I didn't like this so much of a good character in history, with the friendship between Atreus and Thrud the game followed a way where Kratos could not kill Thor.I was disappointed when I realized I wasn't going to get Mjonir as a playable weapon.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it seems to be the motto for this sequel to the 2018 God of War reboot. And you know what? In a way, I'm really glad it was. Sure, in terms of gameplay, it sometimes feels more like an expansion pack of old rather than a full-fledged sequel, but the story is bigger in every way, building beautifully on the breadcrumbs left in the first game. Maybe it speaks to just how fun the reboot’s systems are that I can honestly say Ragnarok will hold a place in my top 10 games of all time for quite a while to come.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Story is unbelievably boring. One of the worst in video games. Fighting is alright. Too many puzzles. Original god of war games were much better.,5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Completed in 37.5 hours, although there’s still quite a bit of side activity left because I simply didn’t want to spoil the fun by forcing myself to find ravens or chests. A fantastic game, it’s hard to say whether the predecessor or this one is better, both are on a very high level. The story, the characters, the atmosphere – top-notch. The soundtrack is probably the best I’ve seen in gaming. Only Hans Zimmer could compete with it in terms of epicness. The only downside is probably the first segment with Atreus and Angrboða in the Iron Woods, where we spend about 2 hours, and it’s just incredibly boring. That part should have been shortened by at least half. But it’s hard to complain about anything else",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Graphics are stunning, but controls are clunky.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War Ragnarök was, for me, an amazing and engaging experience from beginning to end.From the first moments, I felt that the narrative would be even more ambitious than in its predecessor.The relationship between Kratos and Atreus evolves in a very natural way, showing a father more willing to trust his son, but still fighting his own protective instincts.This dynamic is one of the highlights of the game.Each Kingdom of Yggdrasil has a striking visual identity, with very rich scenarios in detail and life.Midgard, now frozen, brings an oppressive atmosphere, while places like Vanaheim offer an explosion of colors and wild nature.The soundtrack only intensifies this immersion, with epic compositions that put you in the skin of a warrior facing colossal challenges. The combat is simply spectacular.The fluid transition between the leviathan ax, the chaos blades and the new elements brought to the kratos arsenal provides a huge tactical variety.Facing enemies with different strategies is never monotonous, especially in the fights against bosses - which, incidentally, are even more challenging and memorable. The story caught me.The weight of Kratos' choices and the journey of self -knowledge of the Atreus is conducted with mastery, addressing topics such as Legacy, Destiny and Redemption.I will not give spoilers, but the climax and outcome are exciting, leaving that taste of mission accomplished, but also a slight melancholy because an epic era may be reaching **** had to highlight a point that made me a little frustrated, would be the linearity of certain missions and some sections that seemed a little stretched without need.Still, this is a small detail against **** General, God of War Ragnarök was an unforgettable journey to me.It is the kind of game that not only delivers visceral action, but also a mature and touching narrative, proving once again that the series is at the top of the world of games.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

God of War: Ragnarok is a masterwork that makes for a perfect next installment to the God of War series.

"Almost everything in God of War: Ragnarok surprises.The outcome of the story of Kratos and Atreus is something that most of us could not anticipate.Gameplay is a clear evolution of the previous game, and the variation of scenarios and enemies prevents the game from becoming boring.In addition, the alternation between controlling Kratos and Atreus ensures more dynamism in gameplay.The charts are very similar to those of the previous generation, so although they are not surprised, they do not disappoint either.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"An absolutely breathtaking game. Builds upon every gameplay element introduced in the first and I would say that the 9 realms in this game were more enjoyable to explore than the first. Much more linear and much easier to remember the different parts of each realm that you had been to. Story is great, although in my opinion doesn't come near to the first. But that is not a bad thing because the first game's story was something I knew couldn't be topped. If you played GOW 2018, you will love this game for sure. Great improvements, and you will have more fun playing Ragnarok for sure, even though the story lacks in comparison to the first. Must play game.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Here is your text translated into English:A game that’s completely mandatory if you have PS Extra, no **** a true fan of the series and having played since the first GoW (I was 13 years old), these are my ratings:As a game: 9.5/10As God of War: 3.5/10Before anyone attacks me, the explanation is **** game is undeniably almost a work of art—everything from the story, the plot, character development, video and audio quality, environments, boss designs, weapons, and magic… that’s why I gave it the score I did as a ****, here’s the big issue.I miss playing a GoW with that immature, brutal Kratos, ripping off heads without thinking of the consequences, going straight for his goal, destroying anything in his path, whether innocent or not, solving problems by obliterating everything without reflecting on **** that’s exactly what I expect from a GoW: that essence of what Kratos was **** make myself clearer:I want to rip eyes out and stab blades into people’s chests, not spend 2 hours looking for fruit for a mammoth with a girl who looks like Zendaya.Playing this game, I can tell you that the moments that truly opened my eyes were the finishing moves on bosses or enemies (R3), because for a brief moment, I saw that real Kratos.Maybe the series nailed the change it made in 2018, and the success of the two games proves **** I think what really hooked us fans was what came before, and the attachment we have to the **** early games stood out for their relentless violence and a fixed camera that turned every setting into an epic spectacle. With today’s technology and graphics, a game in that style would be absolutely ****’s the path I think they should take, and it’s very easy for them.

Kratos is, and always will be, irreplaceable.Thanks for reading until the end :)Let me know if you need any adjustments!",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"Aside from the story and scenery, God of War has very dated gameplay. You don't feel like a god because the smallest enemies can stagger you or even kill you with just a few moves. Invisible walls and a very limited tube-like level design only emphasize it.Enemies sometimes repeat themselves from the previous part. This continues until the end. There are exceptions and interesting / well-staged opponents. Unfortunately too little and with very poor pacing, as many are repeated (**** puzzles are very limited and you sometimes have to do exactly what the developers ask you to do, even if that's exactly how you thought it out, but you don't act with pixel precision. It also takes you more out of the game. It feels like a pattern. Hordes of enemies, hose passages and then monotonous puzzles. If you want to immerse yourself in the story, the unnecessary RPG nonsense will get you out of it. Equipping may be a little improved from the first part, but it's still too much. Like the combat system with the camera problems and the question of whether it should be Hack'nSlay or more tactical Souls-like, the entire game doesn't really know what it wants to be. It was like torture for me until the end. Motivated by the good scenery mentioned at the beginning, the interesting characters and the story. But to get to these points, I have to deal with outdated gameplay that offers poor pacing. It is one of the worst games I have played in 2024.I wish the combat system had been made more fun, short-winded, and freer. Without RPG elements, or really just a minimum of new armor parts. Skill unlocking would also have been nice to be able to happen automatically (and intuitively). Almost everything is ripped out. I would have liked more individuality and variety in the opponents. And when you fight against crowds, please do so in a way that makes you feel like a god (quickly and well staged). And don't laboriously process every hundredth opponent like a stronger one. The strengths were this hidden world, where you later go with Artreus. Epically staged boss fights (not the annoying little bosses), the visual environments (not hose levels), such as on the way to Odin, and the characters in general. 6.2",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"Games like elder ring have perfected difficulty by making you do tons of damage and receive tons of damage. God of war Ragnarok made me regret my decision to push the difficulty up because the enemies and bosses became toooo damn spongy. I hope the studio change this aspect in future games,stop giving enemies so much health when raising the difficulty , its becoming tedious and annoying rather than difficult. Elder ring is difficult, this is tedious there is a difference. Other than that the game is excellent in all aspects",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"The best game I have played in my life, history and characters are things that cannot be ignored, is a game with incredible gameplay",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"An amazing game, if you played GOW 2018 you will really like this one, it's not a revolution, just an evolution, the graphics are way better, the mechanics are polished with new combos, habilities, movements, even weapons, and the story is really good but goes really fast, they wanted to pack everything in this game but for me it would have been necessary another game to end the nordic saga, but besides that, everything is excellent. Highly recommended",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The story mode is a bit short, but overall great.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"10/10!! The game is a literal masterpiece; every gamer needs to experience this godliness in their life. The emotions I experienced throughout this game, the overall feeling it left me with...actually speechless. Will be thinking about this one for the rest of my life.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"A powerful product is many times better from the past.I really liked the plot, very interesting and the emotions were the best.I advise everyone.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
First game from this soft reboot was amazing. But this one is just a DEI slop with extremely repetitive gameplay. Story is a simple teenage drama with unnecessary and very lazy woke garbage. Oh and our beloved character Kratos is just a neutered wimp now.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
The greatest experience you will ever get to feel in life! The last game lacked variety of boss fights and this one here delivers just that. More boss fights plus characters plus new areas to explore it really is just a better version than the last game.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
God of puzzles…because first thing I think of when it comes to Gods & mythologies is all the puzzles,4,PLAYSTATION 5
"A fanstatic story, nice gameplay, one of the best games I have ever played.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"It's good but it could be a lot better, Tyr is a disappointmentt. I hate teenager Atreus",8,PLAYSTATION 5
I just finished this game and I can tell you that this is for now one of the best games ever made especially for ps5 because of the prefect graphics and gameplay. And the story of course. And the whole game is huuuge! It doesn't matter if you're into this kind of games but even so it is a MUST to play.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarok builds on the strengths of its predecessor, delivering an even richer experience. The combat is more refined, with new weapons and abilities adding depth, while the expanded world offers more exploration and variety. The story dives deeper into Norse mythology and character relationships, providing more emotional weight and satisfying arcs. While the first game set the foundation, Ragnarok elevates everything with grander scale, improved pacing, and more impactful moments, making it an unforgettable sequel.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"A fantastic squeal. Good boss fights, great story ad just all round fun. Arteus is growing as a really good character as well.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I liked this game more than the previous 2018 made God of War.1-Graphics could have been better.2-During the resolution of the resolution, the people next to me do this for 10 seconds.3-Kratos game height to Atreus almost no height !!",9,PLAYSTATION 5
God of war Ragnarok is everything from the first game but improved making it one of the best sequels to date.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The woke is strong with this one. They absolutely ruined these characters. The new game engine is klunky, and the ""improved"" visuals aren't worth the trade off. If you love this franchise I would recommend you do yourself a favor and skip this one. This one was a little bit like visiting your best friend from college only to learn they have changed for the worse and you can no longer connect with them. You will wish you had just held on to your good memories of the previous games...",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"They turned Kratos into a soft ass, this game could be called Atreus, Loki or anything other than God of War.This is not Kratos and this is not God of War",0,PLAYSTATION 5
WOW. Really wow. This is by far the best game I ve ever played. And believe me when I say that I have already played a lot of games. I recommend it to everybody who wants to try it. The thing I liked the most is the story and the storytelling.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I didn't think it would be possible, but it's even better than the first part. Unbelievable.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I like this game a lot and it lives up to its expectations. The game overall is quite excellent when it comes to aspects like: exploring, combat and action, and story. Exploring the game's map was quite fun, it was interesting to see little crevices and secret areas I had missed. The action and combat were equally as exciting and thrilling, I loved the finishers and different techniques you could do with the weapons Kratos has. I also loved the story, it was emotional and even eye-catching, which is a massive thumbs up in my opinion. However, I think that this game lacks replayability, as in starting New Game Plus and further because it eventually gets boring.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Its a great game, from amazing graphics to amazing characters, to amazing story and the fact that you get to play as atreus makes it a whole new feeling like you couldn’t do that in God of war 2018 which i think is amazing.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"it’s a great game, but it has some flaws, especially with the pacing. I wish they split into two games instead of one, but overall it’s a great game with great character characters in the part at the end made me cry.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Not bad, but could use more content.Why does it have to end like this!?",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"They tried to made the best game ever. This game looks gorgeous but also very complete without bores you a bit. You chsnged roles, areas, graphics are amazing, story well made. Really the game it was great experience",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The combat, the art design, the animations, the character development, the damn story - this is the game of the century folks. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The story eclipses that of the Witcher 3, the combat blasts Elden Ring out of the park and the world is more beautiful than than Ghosts of Tsushima.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
I love it. I love Kratos. I used to hate Atreus. The gameplay is better than the previous one. More thins to do and upgrade. Music is still in my brain. Combat isnow the standard of industry.,8,PLAYSTATION 5
I’m sorry but this game is heavily overrated. I actually stopped playing this half way through and deleted it from my library because I was so fed up with it. I’m gonna break it down for simplicity. Pros: - amazing cinematography + visuals - characters are well acted and portrayed Cons: - in terms of gameplay I felt it was to linear - I felt bored most of the time and actually procrastinated instead of playing this - the combat is not satisfying at all - some of the puzzles aren’t good at all at giving you hints of what you’re actually supposed to do most of the time. (A game isn’t that fun if you’re having to spend half your play time looking up a tutorial for 1 puzzle after running in circles for half an hour trying to figure out what to do),5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Simply amazing. Great story, graphics, ambience, music and narrative. A must play if you own a PlayStation. Also the Pro patch was a work of art.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Absolutely top Tyr. Rarely is there a game that grips me as much as this one has.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
The game is a great showing of story telling and character development. I just finished my third play through of the game. New game plus gives some tweaks to the mini bosses and boss fights from original play through. It is my second favorite in the franchise.,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Amazing game, good and satisfying gameplay but I feel like something is missing in the story, I can't really explain it",9,PLAYSTATION 5
Combat is bland and boring... gets repetitive and predictible rather quickly. Graphics ok. Story kinda of meh if you are not really into this type of stuff. Only buy because it was on sale. Still dont think this game worth more than 30$.,2,PLAYSTATION 5
"incredible game, hats off to the tam that made it. combat, graphics, character development, story, art, all insanely good. ran well on PC too",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"First of all, the graphics are amazing. The art style and open world are so detailed and well done. The characters are also very well developed and keep you interested. The playthrough can feel routine at times; going to an area, fighting all the enemies, going to the next area, completing a puzzle to traverse to the next section, and repeat. The combat was very well done and fun throughout my playthrough.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Criticism - God of War: Ragnarok Note: 8/10 God of War: Ragnarok is an ambitious and epic sequence that expands the universe of Nordic mythology while deepening the journey of Kratos and Atreus.Developed by Santa Monica Studio, the game raises the narrative and the fight against new levels, but is not free of failures.The story is undoubtedly the highlight.The plot addresses the imminent Ragnarok and the intertwined destinations of Kratos, Atreus and the Nordic gods.The relationship between father and son is even more developed, with emotional moments that exploit confidence, legacy and difficult choices.Secondary characters, such as Freya, Thor, and Odin, are richly characterized, bringing unexpected depth and layers to the narrative.The gameplay is refined and satisfactory.The combat is brutal and dynamic, with the return of Leviathan ax and chaos blades, as well as new elements that maintain fresh experience.The puzzles are well designed, and the exploration in the nine kingdoms is rewarding, with beautifully detailed scenarios and a wide variety of enemies and bosses.However, the part involving the minds divides opinions.Playing as it is an interesting change of pace, but its gameplay is less impactful and less fluid than Kratos, which may break immersion at crucial times.In addition, its parallel history, although it is important to the general plot, may seem dragged on some parts, damaging the pace of the game.Despite these problems, God of War: Ragnarok is still an amazing experience, with a powerful story, impressive visuals and unforgettable combat.Note 8 reflects the grandeur of the game, but also recognizes that not all narrative and gameplay choices have been perfection.If you liked the previous title, Ragnarok is mandatory even with its imperfections.A journey that will certainly be marked in the memory of the players",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Extremely tiring, boring game, monome and with totally uncharacterized characters.Totally the opposite of what the franchise has always delivered.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"Great videogame! The history is one of the strongest things in this game, but also stands with its gameplay I think in depends on what kind of player are you, but I felt this game a little bit slower than god of war 2018, but also great, but in the other hand I have friends that say that this is better than the last one, so that´s on You!",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Only on PlayStation Policy of ""exclusivity"" nothing more than greed, sooner or later not leading to anything good",0,PLAYSTATION 5
Just gome home bought this one and i am satisfied till now,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"overall this game is amazing, thats all I can say, the ending was a bit underwhelming so im removing 1 point. other than that, gameplay is more of what we loved from the 2018 game with improvements and quality of life changes and its great!",9,PLAYSTATION 5
Masterpiece in every way.I liked the previous one that is also milk.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"After 30 hours I was done. In summary it can be said that, like its predecessor, it is a very good game. Starting with the characters and the story staging through to the gameplay and graphics. But the musical background and the underlined tonality of the game are also very good. Nevertheless, just like its predecessor, it didn't keep me consistently entertained. I kept putting the game aside and only picked it up again after a while. I also lack depth in this part when it comes to the setting and Loki is clearly better but was still very annoying, especially at the **** in all it may not be a masterpiece but you have to play it.8/10.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"my all-time favorite game, not boring even after the third playthrough, extremely cool combat system. Spear is fun and the new rune attacks, as well as the bosses are really cool and the story is a masterpiece",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Ragnarök macht direkt da weiter, wo das Preisgekrönte God of War 2018 aufgehört hat. Das Extrem hohe Produktion Value, die wichtigen Kämpfe, die motivierenden Umgebungspuzzles und nicht zuletzt die stilprägende One Shot Kamera catchen auch im Nachfolger sofort wieder. Dabei sind die Areale deutlich weitläufiger und offener geworden, was dem Spiel einerseits gut tut, andererseits aber auch deutlich das Tempo aus der sonst wieder sehr gut erzählten Geschichte heraus nimmt. Wirkte das Erstlingswerk noch wie ein Erlebnis aus einem Guss, hat Ragnarök durchaus mehr mit typischen Open World Nachteilen zu kämpfen, was in solch klar linear erzählten Spielen aber nicht unbedingt entgegen kommt. Ansonsten bietet Ragnarök alles, was den Vorgänger auch schon auszeichnete nur in mehr und in nochmals deutlich hübscherer Kulisse. Neben Horizon Forbidden West ist God of War Ragnarök das grafisch beeindruckendste was man bisher auf der PS5 zu sehen bekommt. Sehr Gut.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Smart choice to make this a duology - this sequel finishes the story with aplomb. Very similar game to the first one, which was the correct choice, as it's hard to improve on something already terrific. The new spear weapon for Kratos gives the combat more variety, as does the different shield options. It's just as epic, beautiful, and heartbreaking as its predecessor. The DLC offers a fun roguelite twist on the gameplay, too.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Fantastic game, the first was good but this one tipped it over the edge, I love how you can have the experience of a relaxed fighter or a really tough fighter",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of love.It summarizes.The direction the franchise is taking worries a lot.I hope you stop inventing, or will stain the franchise.Gameplay is very limited to the present day.",0,PLAYSTATION 5
"The best story game i have ever played, i have played almost every story game out there, i have tried all the games out there, this one is on a different level, 10x times ahead of any story game i have ever played, played the 2018 game it was great, didnt think they could do something better than the 2018 game, and they did we asked for more enemies they gave us we asked for more bosses they gave us, doing side missions are not boring nor repetitive, only down side of this game is the irowood mission, i give that mission a 6/10, but i understand that mission had to happen, other wise i dont think i disliked anything about this game, pure masterpiece, glad i played it, kratos is wiser than ever, glad i grew up playing this game, played the first god of war games when i was 7 years old, and now i feel i am as old as kratos, the writing of the story makes you really attached to the character, well done santa monica, cant wait to try your new games",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Not as good as the first. They crippled Kratos' character and made a bunch of other weird character choices that make no sense.,4,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarok is a masterpiece that perfectly balances deep lore with engaging gameplay. The way it builds on Norse mythology is incredible, weaving a story that feels both epic and deeply personal. Every interaction with the gods and creatures of the Nine Realms adds layers to the lore, making the world feel rich and **** gameplay is just as outstanding. The combat is fluid, brutal, and satisfying, with plenty of options to customize your playstyle. Whether you’re swinging the Leviathan Axe or summoning runic attacks, every fight feels dynamic and rewarding. Combined with jaw-dropping visuals and a perfectly paced story, Ragnarok is a game that’s as fun to play as it is to experience.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Pros - expanded 2018 combat system in all the right ways - breathtaking performances - fun exploration - higher difficulties highlight the best parts of the combat system - insanely better enemy variety compared to 2018 // Cons - the boat/sled exploration is made annoying by voice lines getting repeated every 10 seconds (every Mimir story has two sentences to catch the player up if interrupted, and those can last just long enough to not get anywhere before the new point of interest and then repeat again) // The follow up the incredible God of War 2018 had a lot to live up to. And it somehow exceeded every expectation I had for the game. Every aspect I liked about the 2018 game is better than before and it is not even close. The expanded combat with some of the skills from the previous entry becoming basic abilities is so much fun. New Runic Attacks and the use of the triangle button to add extra potential to every weapon pays off so much that by the first two hours it felt like something that was always a part of the 2018 formula. What aids this feeling is the expanded enemy variety. Several factions, with distinct abilities and bosses that are far more varied than the 2018 six flavors of troll. All of the enemies have clear attack patterns, reducing a lot of the 2018 screen clutter. All of the weapons being part of exploration is also a lot of fun. While the game still has that glued to the ground issue, the blades especially add some much needed briskness to movement. Then there is the story. This game does far more with its narrative than I ever expected. Going through the base game, it builds slowly until about chapter six. After that the game just does not let off the gas, ending in one of the most epic sequences I have ever played. And then comes Valhalla. A free piece of DLC that gives genuinely emotional redemption to Kratos. They cooked with this game. And they cooked hard. All in all, God of War Ragnarök should be a glowing standard to what sequels should be. Improvement on all fronts, with satisfying gameplay and narrative. Could not recommend this game any harder.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Jogo foda...... ... ......... ...............................................,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Totally lives up to the hype. Epic drama, intense action, heartwarming story, well-thought-out gameplay, creative bosses, hordes of lore. I think my only critique is the pacing. To level up efficiently you must do a lot of side quests, and I felt that some of the side quests weren't as executed as well as I'd like and are forgettable.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Improves upon the first in every conceivable way. Bigger set pices, better boss fight, new gameplay mechanics, amazing story and graphics and music",10,PLAYSTATION 5
The biggest blank for the buck,7,PLAYSTATION 5
A game so good I had did 3 play thought. Combat is fine tuned and rewarding. I personally like the more soulslike feel they went with in the new GOW’s and the story is truely immaculate. Love it and recommend it highly,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"this game was too good to end on this way, i hoped that game had a sequel, but it didn´t. although, this game is a masterpiece by santa monica.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Definition of more of the same. And Kratos only gets softer and softer while he strands away from all the characteristics that made him one of the most loved characters ever.,5,PLAYSTATION 5
"More of the 2018 version, but with flaws that show late. This game is a banger in the early hours but becomes very stale gameplay wise. I shouldn't have platinumed it and just left it after the story. The combat is still lackluster and can't decide if you need to have a power fantasy like the old games or a challenging combat experience like the other popular games nowadays but fails at both. It is heavily carried by the acting and funny dialogue which makes it bearable in the end game where the gameplay gets stale.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game for those who like to grow, that is, for streamers.I do not recommend playing the biggest complexity.It all comes down to not missing the blow, and on this complexity it is fatal.Two or three blows - you have a corpse and the game wanted to spit on how much protection/good luck, etc., these are all the cynos for the masturbation.Jerking off the cyno?Handsome!Kratos was turned into a complete sucker of a dying from a plus and this is not an exaggeration.I would better play a toad, which jumps, clings to the walls, gives combo-over, spits with acid and anihilates the Greek god of war from two strokes.Separately, it is worthwhile to thank the developers for the finished checkpoints, there are a lot of them.I went through all the parts of the GOW and everything is on maximum complexity, except for the 4th part, because I realized that I was waiting for me, I did not want to tear out every battle and reduced the difficulty.But the devil pulled me to pass Ragnarek on maximums.Otherwise, I liked the game, everything is cool, here is a huge world that I absolutely do not want to investigate because of the fucking complexity where you need to tear out every fight 10-20 times.I agree with the bosses where you fuck it out only to work, but here every fight is like a boss to tear out.Even if the enemy is only 3 or say 2 or 10 of them, one dick you will jerk off.Have you already caught up with the word ""jerk off""?And I was sick of the whole game from this fucking jerk.FAP FAP FAP !!!",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"Sappy, over-rated, dull game. Takes the formula of the 2018 game and adds terrible dialogue, pointless DEI, and 2-3 hours of Atrius fruit picking. The combat is ok, but honestly… in 2022 I would have expected more. It’s mediocre at best.",6,PLAYSTATION 5
Great game. I wouldn't call if perfect. Same as GOW 2018 but with some improvements. The pacing of the story is all over the place and lacks cool bosses or replayability.,8,PLAYSTATION 5
"A masterpiece, from story to combat, graphics to enemy variety. Highly recommend for everyone.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"It's a great sequel.After the first game, meeting the expectations, the new mechanics added to the gameplay and the way to experience this with the style of the game of great pleasure I wish I had extra 1-2 more space said it was finished.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God Of War Ragnarök masterfully builds upon its predecessor, delivering an epic continuation of Kratos and Atreus's journey through Norse mythology. The game introduces a rich narrative filled with emotional depth, complex character development, and stunning visuals that draw players into its beautifully crafted **** gameplay mechanics are refined, offering a seamless blend of brutal combat and intricate puzzles. The addition of new abilities and weapons enhances the combat experience, allowing for a variety of playstyles. The boss battles are particularly noteworthy, showcasing challenging encounters that require strategy and skill.Visually, Ragnarök is a feast for the eyes. The landscapes are breathtaking, from snow-covered mountains to lush forests, each area bursting with detail. The voice acting and soundtrack elevate the storytelling, immersing players in the emotional stakes of the characters' journeys.However, while the game excels in many areas, some players may find the pacing a bit uneven, with certain segments feeling drawn out. Additionally, there are moments where the narrative could have benefited from tighter editing.Overall, God of War Ragnarök is an extraordinary sequel that successfully expands upon its predecessor's legacy. With its compelling story, engaging gameplay, and stunning presentation, it stands as a must-play title for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarok isn’t just a sequel; it’s a meticulously crafted masterpiece that elevates every aspect of the series. Right from the beginning, you’re drawn into a story that feels like it's woven from the finest threads of Norse myth and human emotion. Every character, from Kratos to the supporting cast, has depth and complexity that keeps you invested throughout. It’s rare to see storytelling of this caliber in gaming – the kind that makes you care, that feels profound and rich with purpose.Visually, Ragnarok is a feast for the eyes. Each realm is meticulously crafted, bringing a variety of landscapes and atmospheres that feel distinct and full of life. The environments range from icy fjords to fiery pits, and each locale feels like its own unique world, brimming with detail. These environments are not just backdrops but are intricately connected to the narrative, making exploration feel purposeful and **** gameplay builds upon the foundations of the previous installment with a variety of new dynamics and fresh combat mechanics that keep the experience exciting. Every encounter and puzzle feels balanced, challenging you just enough to feel rewarding while constantly **** the end, God of War: Ragnarok stands tall as more than just a follow-up. It’s an unforgettable journey and a modern gaming classic – a testament to what happens when every piece ****, from the story to the visuals to the gameplay, is crafted with artistry and passion. A must-play for any fan of the genre and a defining moment for the medium itself.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"I love this game. I was able to play all of the series, and so far, they are doing great. I hope it will continue to be of the same quality.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"8.6 rounded at 9. It is a good game with memorable and emotional moments, but does not reach the level of the previous one.It is appreciated the improvements that they introduced to combat and that include a new weapon, but there are decisions that I do not understand, how the allusions to which x world is more *difficult *.They are comments that take you suddenly, since they shout at all voices ""This is a video game.""Maybe I am judging it too rudely at this point, but I think they are serious sins for a video game that takes to make want to tell a story",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Much like the first game, the other characters that aren't Kratos or the blacksmiths are pretty much forgettable or annoying. They hold this game back from being what could've been modern masterpieces. Both games had the potential to be timeless classics but instead are just good visual feasts that are gonna be forgotten through the years.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War Ragnarok is an excellent game!Best than that of 2018 when it was difficult to do better.Indeed, the scenario is very interesting and moving from start to finish, the main and secondary characters are very interesting and endearing, the game is superbly magnificent graphically, the annex content is also interesting, the music of the game is epic, as for the gameplay it is rather correct, it is not exceptional but is not either bad, however I preferred the Boss of Gow of 2018",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"How to improve Gow 2018's masterpiece?How to improve a game that was practically 10?As Santa Monica has asked these questions and has taken us to the market this impressive continuation, which can perfectly be the game of the year.The gameplay is incredibly good, more complex than the previous one, but with much greater depth.Graphically it is beautiful, I still wonder how a PS4 can move this.An aspect to highlight is the soundtrack, it will allow you to play everything in the spot hair.A magnificent experience and those that leave you a vacuum that you don't know what game play, because Gow Ragnarok is not going to be.11 of 10, thank you very much Santa Monica for this experience.Thank you very much Kratos ️",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Atreus is theonly problem. His parts are boring, fortunately, the parts with Kratos are good. Atreus and the others companion just spoil every puzzles in the game and it's really annoying.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"As much as I’ve been enjoying the world and combat in God of War Ragnorok, the game’s narrative and level design is really starting to ruin the experience for me. It forcefully pushes you along from set piece to set piece without letting any of the big moments breathe and at the same time, those big moments don’t seem to have much impact at all. (compared to scenes I remember in GOW 2018 at least) Any attempt at exploration outside of the game's line of direction gets you yanked back by annoying flavourless dialogue telling you that you should probably be getting a move on now. If your gonna talk while I’m exploring at least make the dialogue worth listening to. On top of this, solving most of the puzzles seems to only get you nothing but a dry well done from your companions as they hastily continue to shove the solution down your throat every 5 seconds. I’ve had moments where puzzle hints still came up after solving the puzzle myself. I did not buy this game so I could feel like a child. Please let the game just be quiet, for 5 minutes. Why is Sony so scared of letting their players fail? Your characters do not need to fill every moment of silence. Not every item pick-up needs to be acknowledged. Not every action needs a quip attached to it. I’m just left feeling disappointed as God of War 2018 gave you plenty of moments to reflect on things said and actions taken in previous scenes, this game just throws Marvel-level quips in your face. It feels unfocused and diminishes all of its attempts at the emotional moments scattered across the story.",5,PLAYSTATION 5

"This is not god of war **** like the previous chapter. The son of kratos is boring and annoying. Except for the graphics it is an empty game with few stupid riddles, few enemies and too easy.

"Very strong 8. A must play if you’re craving a AAA adventure filled with stunning scenery, beefy sound design, Hollywood level acting, and a thrilling time beating up monsters on a moderately challenging level. Pacing and flow is prioritized. I often use this game as a benchmark for what I think a fun action game should be. However, in an adventure I’m also looking for a story to remember, and to be emotionally invested. GOW makes the effort and is reaching for all that too, but the masculine power metal lyric energy just makes it impossible for me to embrace. I would’ve needed a straighter story focusing on some core philosophical question, but instead it’s mostly about the X magical purple portals, defeating Y inter dimensional beast guardians and of course gathering ye olde saving the planet army of best friends you met 9 minutes ago.",8,PLAYSTATION 5

"If you've played God of War 2018 then you've already played this game. Don't be surprised if you end the game feeling a bit disappointed with it. Gameplay and graphics hasn't changed much, but the plot is much worse. This is probably due to the new writers. And yes the Angrboda/sweet baby inc controversy is well deserved. A better way to add representation to the game would be to have a god from Egypt, Africa or Japan stalk Kratos around the game world through cut scenes, perhaps assisting him during a boss fight and then making a final appearance during the post credits to say that they need to bring him to their land for a mysterious purpose. The fact that I or other fans online could write better representation shows why the criticism is valid.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
It's like I'm playing the DLC of the previous game.,5,PLAYSTATION 5
"This review is not influenced by the PSN account requirement. Gameplay is excellent, and there is a healthy suite of visual and performance options. However, I found the story lacking (especially when compared to GoW2018), the character designs for a few of the new characters are hit or miss, but the most egregious offender was the extremely poor, somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I half expected Kratos to shout “Boy! Let’s hop in da sled and bounce out this joint!”, it’s that badly written. It really detracted from the experience, and I found it quite immersion breaking.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"A worthy sequel of the first game. I was not a fan of the story at the beginning, but it got much better in the second half. Pros: - Amazing story. With great cinematics and acting it's almost a movie when the cutscene starts to play - Challenging and satisfying fights. Along with the leveling up and trying to complete all the weapon combos trainings. - Music. - Well-written, believable characters. Cons: - After playing Baldur's Gate 3, the gameplay felt limiting (I know. This is a different kind of game) - Atreus can be annoying at the beginning. - This is a long game with not much variety in gameplay. Fights are fun, but they started to be a slog when I was trying to earn a Platinum Trophy.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

For me I would have an excellent closure for Kratos and Domen Banco a minigame of O with Freya and Kratos.Has a 9 because of the iron forest,9,PLAYSTATION 5
A great sequel to the Nordic saga. Action is still great while adding some new stuff to your weapon list. The world gets even bigger with new and old places to explore. New enemies added as well. The story continues (a recap is available too) from the point we left it. Playing as Atreus was really negative and boring from my point of view and i just wanted it to end. Overall experience was great.,8,PLAYSTATION 5

One of the best games I've ever play ! So emotional story ! Only we need the next chapter.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I found the story epic but also kind of milquetoast with not many revelations. It felt like I was playing Marvel's God of War endgame; the tone and vibe felt a bit off from the previous entries in the series. The Ragnarok section was awesome in spectacle but underwhelming in terms of boss fights; both Thor and Odin were weak and disappointing to fight. I guess that was kind of the point; it's now dad of war; he's not the old Kratos anymore. still. I was expecting a bit more after all the buildup; they played it too safe, in my opinion. The Atreus parts were a chore to get through; good for his development in the story, but gameplay-wise not so much. The side quests also felt like a chore, but they're optional, so it's a non-issue. Not the masterpiece that I was expecting as a conclusion to the Norse mythology arc, but still a really great time and a game that's worth playing.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"I really enjoyed the game but I honestly think this is inferior compared to GOW 2018: the graphics are definitely better, but the story is not as good as the previous one. Something remarkable are the beautiful scenarios that the game has and the different world as Asgard and the representation of gods like Odin.",8,PLAYSTATION 5

The themes of paternity and fate resound deeply throughout the adventure.In short, God of War Ragnarök is an essential masterpiece for video game fans.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

Luckily can turn down difficulty midway without affecting trophies",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Excellent followup to God of War (2018) I actually liked it quite a bit more than the first. The story, the world building, the characters. Graphically it’s one of the best games of the 2020’s. One thing that the GOW franchise does better than anyone is how the story unfolds through the natural conversations of the characters while you’re playing. It makes for a seamless experience as opposed to clicking through dialog trees. 9/10",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"Simply disappointing game where they promised and did not deliver half another game sunk by the need for seal.God of War and a game where you explore the kingdoms this time completely.Game had its evolution since its predecessor but I think it was lost in the essence of a God of War with a very deconstructed Kratos where it does not want to kill even a fly.And this proves in Boss Fights and its finals that are horrible where they deconstruct the bald so much that it simply becomes a big daddy who wants to ensure peace above all, in the first one proves more real than ever where Kratos killed according to his needs is to put threat or just disturbance, changing his character but not his essence.God of War Ragnarok has a shallow exploration without any major change which is a return from his predecessor where he had much more spells and talismans there.Its combat is simply amazing one of its great strengths where it is quite satisfactory and dynamic.Its story is simply a disappointment where there is nothing more than there is no climax or an interesting development only disappointing.The characters have a very unnecessary focus where there are stories that do not close and end with loose points which can be explained by their launch pressure where it was not possible to end in a more decent way.Atreus in this game at a very unnecessary and boring focus where your gameplay is repetitive and bland having the most boring part from afar.God of War Ragnarok I believe it is a return in question to his predecessor who surpasses him in everything but in the graph simply a giant disappointment to everyone who expected a twilight of the Nordic gods where everyone looks like a little friend who want no harm to anyone, Odin has always been portrayed as trash and in this game he looks reasonable without motivation for the player to hate him.This game could be much more pity that they had this idea to make 2 games in one, where everything was very fast and unnatural where each character has their dubious choices.A great disappointment with what he could be and what he was.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War: Ragnarok continues the 2018 reboot's trend, which diverges significantly from the original trilogy. Earlier titles, known for their fast-paced combat, mythological depth, and Kratos' rage-fueled vengeance, set a high standard in the action-adventure genre. Ragnarok, while visually stunning and narratively rich, adheres to the more cinematic, story-driven approach. This shift in focus, with a slower pace and increased emphasis on character development, has alienated some long-time fans. The departure from the original formula is seen by some as diluting the essence that made God of War iconic, replacing relentless action with introspective storytelling. In summary, the current formula is perceived by some as detracting from the series' core appeal, overshadowing its legendary status with a different gameplay experience.",4,PLAYSTATION 5

"If there is a game that “improves upon perfection,” then this it is. God of War Raganrok is my favorite game of all time for a reason. It took what made God of War 2018 so good and somehow improved upon its predecessor in basically every fathomable aspect. The story was way more emotional and heavily weighted, the combat is a no brainer, the exploration is so much bigger with more areas to explore, the side quests are actually lore/story consistent unlike most of them from the 2018 title, and don’t even get me started on the Valhalla dlc. Sure the game isn’t perfect and it has some minor pacing issues from time to time but putting those aside, it’s honestly non existent comparing the good to the bad. The story is more complex and handles deeper topics like tragedy, sacrifice, and suffering. Those ideas were handled absolutely flawlessly and it actually made me shed a tear in some points. The writing is absolutely impeccable. From start to finish, this is the pinnacle and peak of the entirety of the God of War franchise. The literal best game that Santa Monica has to offer. I cannot recommend this game enough as to how impactful and life changing it is. Easily and 11/10 when you include Valhalla. This is how games are supposed to me made.

"I'm amazed this game is such a step back from the previous game and everyone is giving it a pass. Yes, the traversal is all massively improved and combat has more depth and combos, but that's just enough to get through the game. The game is just as visually stunning as the previous one with some noticeable touch ups to textures, but some of the level design is just awful, especially Ironwood which is essentially a junkyard in a swamp with some grey and reddish purple but mostly piss yellow and diarrhea brown (all the while Atreus is saying ""this is BEAUTIFUL!"" But I guess some people like looking at a used public toilet that backed up a long time ago?) The voice acting is quite good and the characters feel like realistic versions of gods and demi gods at times, at other times it's not very good and even bad. But the writing and themes, my god. Imagine any political hot topic from global warming to European colonialism exploiting other races to the evils of WHALING. And that's just within the first few hours and it's not very subtle or smart, but instead incredibly preachy and incessant. Constantly hitting you over the head with these messages, and it only gets worse the longer you play the game. It's unbelievable. It's a shame too because some of these themes work with the story being told here, it's just HOW it's told to you that makes it annoying or, worse yet, boring. On my new game+ I just put the game on mute and turned off subtitles, game became that much better. There really is nothing wrong with the story itself, it's a solid follow up to what happened in the previous game with both Kratos's journey as a father now with more focus on Atreyu growing into his own legend, and ultimately how that all ties in with the overall arc of the gods of Aesgard trying to prevent Rägnarök. But these writers cobbled this **** together without any real cohesive vision and the final result is a preachy, long winded slog. Really disappointing.",4,PLAYSTATION 5

The story is amazing( other than johtenheim) and the gameplay is too. Kratos and Atreus are the best father son duo out there.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
A great story with top-notch visuals and an insufferable combat system. In the last quarter I switched to Easy to stop being one-shotted every now and then by a random mob. I mostly hated the combat in this one. Atreus is OP and Kratos is weak as !@#$%^. Totally unbalanced.,7,PLAYSTATION 5
"The definition of mid. Bring back the Kratos from 1-3 as well as the gameplay loop. This ""game"" feels more like a podcast with guests appearing everynow and then just bickering with each other throughout the entire time. When the gameplay finally does happen it's good. But compared to its much better predecessor in God of War 3, it's just mid overall. 5/10",5,PLAYSTATION 5
God of war ragnarok is one of the best games i`ve ever played. The story is a masterpiece and the plottwist are very good. The game has very good and beautiful character development. 10/10,10,PLAYSTATION 5
Great game but feel like dowmgrade in some terms from the 2018 games which disappointing,8,PLAYSTATION 5
Absolutely S tier game. One of the greatest. Improves on everything from GoW 2018. Only criticism I have is the Berserkers are an ugly design. But Gna is an awesome fight.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
GOWR is an absolutely beautiful game with a stunning story and a completely unique way of playing. It is rare you find a game that can have you hooked and focused in a battle and then sit back and have goosebumps from the cinematically perfect game like this. It is in my opinion a perfect sequel to GOW4 and with it based in norse mythology it teaches you a lot about the norse history and it tells you in a fun way. It was my game of the year but sadly did not win. A perfect game to try but you will have to play GOW4 before Ragnarok to understand the story and characters.,10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Meh ill be honest im not the biggest fan of santa monicas god of war. His a character that they said ""we need to fix him and give him retribution!"" But i mean he didnt need it. Dude was a revenge driven power house. God of war ragnorak again is lacking in the music department where the original triliogy to this day is so memorable. I cant remember a single song from ragnorak and i played it recently. The atreus segments were god awful. Once i reached asgard i took a 3week break before trying again. One section felt likestraight up splatoon were atreus and the girl were throwing colors everywhere. It honestly did not feel like god of war anymore. The brutal games were kratos was ripping out cyclops eyes and guttin centaurs are no more. Now enemies are killed and turn into fairy dust. Now atreus and his friend throw crayons and arrows. I also had to deal w an annoying bug that made it impossible to beat a side quest. I think an enemy fell and despite having killed every enemy along the way i was unable to beat a favor for a ghost and i tried countless times and even returning much later and searching everywhere and the spirit was still waiting for me telling me to kill off enemies near by. Also idk why the director thought it was a good idea to make this game inclusive when its M for Mature. They made this like it was meant for children cause every boss fight, every puzzle, every possible exploration area i had to hear allys telling me what to do. Ive been gaming for years i know what aoe attacks are. I know what homing orbs do. I dont need to be told to shoot them down by atreus lol.i dont need santa monica holding my hand while i play the 9th entry in god of war series and its mature. Music 6/10 not memorable Combat 9/10 combat was fun and can be changed to fit user style Graphics 9/10 this game is beautiful to look at. Replay value 3/10 not much to do after you platinum on first playthrough. Part of inclusivity issue is making platinums easily attainable by all gamers ages 0-60 lame Story 7/10 story was hype before release but honestly kinda let me down. The plot twist was kinda obvious early on. Overall id say ragnorak is an ok followup to 2018. Fans of 2018 will enjoy this title. Combat is the strong point for the game. Kratos segments are the best parts. Personally have zero interest in any atreus spinoffs. This game was a beat once and delete to make space type off game. Rogue like mode that was added afterwards was real fun. But not fun enough for me to keep god of war installed lol",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"Remember the old track and field games. Where you would mash two buttons to get to the finish line, well here’s that same game with a bit of Norse Mythology. If you love boring gameplay with an average story and annoying protagonist (Atreus). Everyone knows if you had to sit through this for 30 hours you’d rather do it as Kratos apart from the developers!",3,PLAYSTATION 5

Although the first game (2018) had more magic in it as far the story goes but the sequel surprised me in some of the directions it went in. The star of the show is the action packed gameplay with some minor additions of new attacks that work well. All in all a great experience that will leave you wanting more and a showcase of why singer player First party games are extremely needed in the gaming hemisphere.,9,PLAYSTATION 5

"When gameplay of God of War 2018 was released, I remember everyone being concerned about Atreus and worry about him in combat, or being the annoying kid character that distracts from the main story of Kratos. Those concerns were addressed by the devs as they explained that Atreus would only assist in combat and solving puzzles, not playable, and only added to bring a depth and gravity to the life of Kratos. And that is exactly what happened when you played tha game. However, in GOW Ragnarök, Atreus has become the main focus of the story and a playable character no one wanted. The most boring combat and forced story plots as a way to add a convoluted and unconvincing passing of the torch to the next generation at the expense of everything that made GOW 2018 so special...a disconnected father and son finding themselves and developing a genuine relationship by navigating the complexities of grief by losing the most important person in both their lives. Beautifully, utilizing small moments throughout the main beats of the story to equalize pace and add a realistic tone to character development without completely changing the characters themselves. But....Ragnork.....Atreus is an dumb and confused teenager who feeds whatever plot is needed for the convoluted story choices by the writers who obviously tried to cram every character mentioned in a google search for Nordic mythology. Lazy writing turning Kratos into an apologetic helicopter pilot needing to apologize for not understanding the perspective of his idiotic kid. We wanted God Of War and we got God of Angst. The devs and technical people who worked on this game get a 10/10. However, the story writers get a 5/10 for flicking their boogers at everyone who bought the game.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"Great combat, Great story. You don't actually have to play the other games to understand what going on. Amazing graphics, amazing sounds effects. Gowr is the perfect game to start on with the ps5. Ending is quite ''basic'' with uneeded deaths but it's still great. This would have been a 10/10 if they din't have to make you play as atreus in a cool purple forest for 3 hours straight just to help a girl to her shores lol.

If I didn't know the old games my score would be 0.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"Ragnarok made me so mad when I first played it. I kept getting stuck on the puzzles and I kept losing fights, I then realized I just **** at video games and once I finally got a hang of the puzzles it was extremely fun. Maybe not as good of a story as 2018 but it still has an incredible story that I can't wait to see be continued. Do yourself a favor and play it as soon as you can.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
the graphics is nuts the story is look forward for god of war future I loved the first and the final mission (Kratos Freya Atreus vs Odin) Kratos VS Thor was nuts too brock death was shocking with the funeral,8,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War Ragnarök is overall an improvement over 2018. It’s story conflict feels way better developed and the writers actively take advantage of the games setting. Major plot points are no longer condensed to just Midguard anymore which I greatly appreciate. The story’s focus does tend to get unclear throughout, but overall it manages to be memorable and interesting and feels like it moves characters in a meaningful way. Gameplay wise this game is on God of War autopilot. It makes the typical play it safe improvements without adding anything that wowed me. Better enemy variety, better boss fights, better level design (except Vanahiem, that place can go die in a hole) etc. Still hate the gooey RPG elements, but it is what it is I guess. Overall God of War Ragnarök does what is to be expected from a sequel game.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"I really enjoy this game, I love the character development, and definitely the new skills because I use glacial lake too much. (its overpowered) I love the combat, it is very smooth and clean. It also has very good graphics which are very stunning. The only reason i didnt like it there was a couple of missions that felt really slow and boring, like Ironwood, very slow.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"What a great experience, great characters better worldbuilding than GOW 4, better graphics, great story, good improvement on the combat compared to GOW 4,really good bosse, I loved the DLC perfect for Kratos. The bosses are way better than in the previous game and a really emotional game for the player,Odin is the embodiment of a villain . The only downsides are probably the puzzles (too much and boring), of course Ironwood tho it's pretty good for Atreus character but not fun playing it. and unfortunately we did get much of Asgard before the Ragnarök. 9.-9.5/10 game",9,PLAYSTATION 5
the first few hours of the game are quite boring in a way that you feel like you're playing expansion of GoW 4 instead of new game. However the story becomes very intense and the gameplay eventually starts to differentiate from previous game at some point which makes every hour worth of playing that game,9,PLAYSTATION 5

Everyone needs to experience this game.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War Ragnarok is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends breathtaking visuals, immersive storytelling, and adrenaline-pumping gameplay into an unforgettable gaming experience. Building upon the success of its predecessor, this installment takes players on an epic journey through Norse mythology, where they assume the role of the formidable warrior, Kratos, once again.From the moment you step into the shoes of Kratos, you're immediately drawn into a world teeming with rich lore and vibrant characters. The game's narrative unfolds with cinematic flair, weaving together themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the complexities of fatherhood. Kratos' relationship with his son, Atreus, serves as the emotional core of the story, adding layers of depth and resonance to every encounter.Visually stunning landscapes and meticulously crafted environments breathe life into the realms of Norse mythology. From the towering peaks of Asgard to the depths of Helheim, each location is rendered with breathtaking detail, making exploration a feast for the senses. Dynamic weather effects and day-night cycles further enhance the immersion, creating a world that feels alive and constantly evolving.Combat remains the heart of the God of War experience, and Ragnarok delivers in spades. The fluid, responsive combat mechanics from the previous game are refined and expanded upon, offering a satisfying blend of brutal melee encounters and strategic prowess. Kratos' arsenal of weapons and abilities has been expanded, allowing for greater customization and playstyle diversity. Whether you prefer to unleash devastating combo attacks or rely on precise timing and parries, the combat system offers ample opportunities for mastery and experimentation.Beyond its captivating story and exhilarating gameplay, God of War Ragnarok excels in its attention to detail and commitment to immersion. From the haunting melodies of its orchestral score to the nuanced performances of its voice cast, every element comes together to create a truly immersive experience that resonates long after the credits roll. In conclusion God of war Ragnarok is a MUST PLAY FOR ANYONE and this game captures the essence of perfection",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"More of the same from 2018? Seriously underwhelming. Possibly not my style of gaming but I really loved the series before God of War Ragnarok and God of War (2018). Played all the way through God of War, and it felt like a narrow corridor with attention to close ups in cutscenes and very predictable popularity without spine or essence. I still have no idea why its still praised, when God of War 3 on modern graphics would be a far superior game with the two combined",0,PLAYSTATION 5

"Fantastic story,graphics,Secondarymissione,plot,Allllllllllllll fantasticcc",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Here are my pros and cons about God of war Ragnarok . The good . The father and son moments with Kratos and Atreus . Number 2 a much better boss / enemy fight which is a much step compared to 2018 where it was limited . Number 3 the combat is good when you get the spear . Number 4 Brock and Sindri by far the best part in the game . Okay that was good and here the cons Number 1 there still no option for a field of view setting. Because the camera in this is the best. Like would to have a better view in the environment to do a better dodge or parry with but making camera look weird . But the game work better for Atreus because the game work well for shooting . Number 2 I didn't care for Kratos dead wife and felt nothing with them. Number 3 why is the game like to hold your hand . Because moments you think you need to move but turns it does it for you . And why is there climbing your mechanic like uncharted . Because climbing to Asgard should be something finding money armor or runic attacks . and if you F up you die . But there isn't . Number 4 any mission as Atreus they are so god damn boring . Mostly where your with angrboda . And this been on my mind since beating this in end of 2023. There is bearly any reason to play ragnarok. Is not a bad game I just didn't care when it's over .,7,PLAYSTATION 5

"Good story, good battle system. Invisible walls is disappointed, sponge enemies on high difficulty are frustrating. However it's great game!",10,PLAYSTATION 5
I am just blown away by the graphics and thought put into this game; this is quite honestly the standard of games to look up to. The combat in this game just blows me away - as it develops off the last game to become something more. This game is something you can truly enjoy and not finish soo fast. Also adding onto the story and just how amazing and well crafted it was giving a emotional story to a magnificent game.,9,PLAYSTATION 5
Multiplayer mode is awesome with friends.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
Too many difficult puzzles. Good story. Good voice acting. Well made game.,7,PLAYSTATION 5
"The game itself is, just... meh. Filled with unnecessary busy work, the game seems to revel in the grind, which is quite boring compared to the original. Yes, the original had grind, but it didn't feel as though that was all the game was. The story isn't bad, but seems irrelevant to the game, almost as if it was tacked on, rather than being the main part of the game. The big twist reveal is interesting, but poorly executed and certain NPC characters are as bland as mild cheese. I don't hate it - quite. But I am struggling to convince myself to play the game for a second time, which is a shame because I loved the first game and enjoyed playing it again.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"Not bad, but could use more content.Why does it have to end like this!?",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"One of the most boring games I played in my entire life. Classic super homologate triple A gameplay filled with super boring sections. When you was playing as Atreus in the iron wood sections I was really thinking on giving up the game. The story is averall pretty uninspired and half baked. The UI of the Kratos/Atreus upgrade menus is a complete mess. The camera, just like the 2018 predecessor suits very badly the gameplay style of the game. The enemy are spongy, thebosses are repeated over and over, the level design is super linear, the puzzles are offending and pretty mandatoryif you want to have upgrades. I really start to question how games like these continue to gather 10/10 scores everywhere.",2,PLAYSTATION 5
"this is a very different game from the OG god of war games. the combat system is better than 2018, with more meaningful decisions and mob varieties. Production quality is very high and there is a large amount of core + optional content. Too much time spent on cutscenes, especially for filler content. disney/marvel-type of plot, a disappointingly safe progression of events. Takes little to no risks unlike its predecessors bold and brutal approaches. it had potential to be a masterpiece but the glaring issues with the last 25% of the game having rushed plot development and almost illogical sequence of events, leaves much to be desired",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"A game that shines for its narrative, its outstanding way of telling it and how well incorporated it is in its gameplay which is also of great quality.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Even on easy mode, the gameplay is difficult. Not a fun game when you can’t beat a boss or solve impossible puzzles",1,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War Ragnarok is a game so much in history that tells it in a very good way together with the codices that even something secondary is important to understand the whole story of this game, also the mechanics that although most of these copied from the previous one includes new mechanics that make a little face washing, for the only one that does not reach 10 because I do not like it to have to spend the game for the first time to be able to skip you.",8,PLAYSTATION 5

"You want to play the story of the story gets the side tasks whether the dialogues get all the tasks, and I have never been bored at all, a head work was really effort.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"GoW Ragnarok takes many things from the first one, improves it a little, and follows the same line as the first trilogy, you load little from the previous game, start almost from zero and have to improve everything again, the problem is that this works better in game structure of the original trilogy. Kratos here is very soft, you can even understand it in the context of wanting to be with his son, but he went beyond the point and became too soft. The dialogue got worse, it received a few Marvel elements, it received a hint of ""comic"". The game has some pretty grueling gameplay parts, involving walking without combat. I certainly had fun with the game despite its problems, but I was also happy that I got it on a 60% off sale, it wasn't worth full price. One of the things I liked most was Odin, he is the best created character for me, they managed very well to make him seem like ""the manipulator"", being able to deceive even the players, you know he is ""evil"" due to his past actions, but in person he never seems bad.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"Santa Monica did it again, absolutely amazing game. Game was better and quite a bit longer than the previous installment. However it didn't have the ""tug at your heart strings"" like story that 2018 did. Atreus and Kratos relationship was tested but became stronger. Kratos has become a different God than he once was.

"The 4th generation main story plot is good, the compact shock is shorter, the 5th generation main story is not good, but the branch line is full of large quantities, the 4th generation combat experience is better, and the 5th generation process operating system is well optimized (such as climbing the wall, teleportation, decryption, the three goddesses of fate treasure chest ringing bell, automatic blood eating, etc.), each has its own advantages and disadvantages, all of which are 93~94 points, and the test rate to the fourth generation is the first to play, so the feelings are given 94 points, and the fifth generation adds DLC, and then two points, 95~96 points.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Unfortunately, this game is much worse than God of War 2018 and feels very unfinished. The final battle is a joke, it looks like there was not enough budget to develop a good second part of this story. Battle system feels not responsive and broken (enemies just stick to you like your distance doesn't matter, animations are lagging quite often). Traveling accross locations often is challenging and not pleasant because of their weird level design. It is very easy to stuck in some parts like Vanheim. Characters motivation often is not consistent and childish. Overall, this game is not bad, but can make you feel disappointed if you played previos games in this series and have high expectations.",7,PLAYSTATION 5

"Meh, kind of expected it after 'God of War' (2018). Yes, they improved things here and there, but it's all of mechanical value, quantity over quality, aiming to be more appealing to wider audiences. It ****, simply. As always happen, after sweating and bleeding to conceive something new but of timeless value, sacrificing oneself through struggles of dealing with the most inner emotions and deepest spiritual realms, sculpting the piece of art with mature sensibility and taste, creating one world that speaks for itself and by itself, corporate greed takes over from there with their tasteless 'safe formulas' to reach more audiences and make more money with chapter 2. It's some kind of a rule, ain't it? Damn, I wouldn't be surprised if Fortnite dances would get integrated in chapter 3... Anyway, simply put, 12-year-old kids can play and understand these dialogues and plots and refer to them on their deepest level, 'cause it's shallower than a freaking swamp in the street, you know, much ground dug but little gold found. Now, if you will excuse me, I'll go replay a part where Kratos contemplates profound silence on Freya's boat, losing himself in the wells of Athena's eyes... Man, just that part alone speaks more than this whole gameplay of 20+ hours.",1,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War is a single player experience and is undoubtedly one of PlayStation's most important franchises, with many excellent quality games.After the success that was the God of War 2018 in a new mythology the expectation was huge to know what would happen in the new adventure of Kratos in the Nordic lands.Fortunately, this new game has managed to do what it promised, gameplay has improved a lot because the boss fights are spectacular, added a lot of new things that give a new look and change the game experience completely, added many more enemies and bosses, something that has been widely criticized in the past game, in this game there are very good bosses but also very difficult to remember the Valkias of the previous game, but the RPG system has evolved something that is pense being pensaNegative considering that the God of War franchise has never been known to be an RPG game and I also think these elements should be simplified, the chart got even better, Soundtrack was amazing as usual in the franchise, the environment and the scenarios are beautiful and each of the new kingdoms are unique and fabulous in many ways encouraging players to use photo mode so they can use their creativity to take pictures to take pictures to take pictures to take pictures to take pictures to take pictures in thatBeautiful world, not to mention the technical perfection, because the game has practically no technical problem and if it has neither serious nor affects gameplay.Speaking of the story, it is much more complex than any other God of War, responded to several things, but did not respond to others and in the end left very open giving evidence to a possible continuation even in the Nordic world despite what the developers said, the game tells an exciting story however, although the time was high the end seemed a little in a hurry because there were some characters that did not have enough development, the game also suffered from pacing problems during the so much problemFamous Angrboda.The relationship of Atreus with Kratos was so well done in this game that the story seems not just about Kratos but also about the Atreus, if this is good or not depending on whether to like the character of Atreus, Brok, Sindri and Freya are also much better in this game because they show that they have much more emotions in this game because we see they pass difficulties and sometimes to overcome it, so that the story goes beyond Kratos, the story goes beyond KratosIt also evolved a lot from the past game.Odin and Thor are excellent characters, for example players can feel empathy for Thor, because we realize the difficulties he goes through during the game and Odin is a very good villain because he was always referred to as someone intelligent and manipulating and this game managed to deliver it, because during the game I think Odin could not only kratos and trades but also the player, we could also understand the reasons for his incessant search for knowledge becauseSome players fell into their lies when in a specific part of the game they believed Odin was not the villain of the story.Secondary missions are better in this game, with more exploration to do, one of which changes the scenario of a part of a kingdom and others we learn more about Mimir and Faye, so I recommend doing all the secondary missions.To conclude, I highly recommend this game, God of War Ragnarok, in my opinion is a work of art, it is the best game of 2022, one of the best games ever and is a mandatory game for everyone who has a playstation at home due to excellent gameplay, a wonderful graphic, very good soundtrack, high -end, memorial and exciting story.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

I love the game so much. The story is beautiful and Thor is damn prefect. He has the perfect body and personality. they could have definitely done more with him.

"What a way to start 2024. This is the first game that happened to me of 2024 and my God who marvels.This game takes everything God of War does and multiplies it but it is great.We are going to start with the story (without spoilers) but it is a complete barbarity the evolution of characters that have kratos and aleus is very well carried very well and has parts where you can really get excited and parts where you put your hair to tip, kratos as the protagonist eats the screen every time you come out and stay with your mouth open, apart you are accompanied by characters (FreyThrud, Odín, Thrud ...) and could continue, all those characters that we are going to say that they are more ""secondary"" are also a complete wonder how well written.The game at the level playing is very fun with a very refined and very satisfactory combat especially when you play as Kratos (which is most of the time but there are also several sections with Domen) the exploration is also great and encourages you to continue exploring to discover chests, secret rooms, secondary missions ... that speaking of secondary missions have exceptional quality and many of them seem main.I also want to mention the soundtrack that is a complete pass how good it is and the sensations it generates when the soundtrack is mixed with kratos on screen.Now if we talk about more technical aspects at the graphic level it looks great in PS5 with shocking and quality moments and at the level of performance also without problems, all perfect, no fall.In summary, a very powerful way to start the year, a real game that together with the God of War 4 make an adventure for brutal Nordic kingdoms.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"Great locations and graphics. Story is awful, it's not God of War, but some cheap ""Santa Barbara"" series. Gameplay repetitive, too much crap puzzles.

"Definitely a big letdown for me. A game that is really popular with adults, treating it's players like mindless toddlers. The puzzles are extremely underwhelming, not to mention that every time you start a puzzle, within 30 seconds a stupid NPC will always give away the answer, no matter what you do. The combat for the most part is good, not much improvements over the last game, only one new weapon was added, the traversal is very, very boring, linear and predictable, full of invisible walls that strip away player freedom, there is no way to be creative, no way to try something different, and the parts where you get to play as Atreaus are the worst of the whole game by far. The story is ok, there is one good plot twist and the rest is just very predictable and safe, not to mention that the ending was very rushed. One of the things that killed this game for me were the comic relief parts, I swear to God sometimes it feels like you are watching a Marvel movie and not playing a God Of War game rated 18+ only. For me it felt like the developers tried to please every audience, appealing to the more mature players with the gore and blood and the younger crowd with stupid jokes and comic relief that feels completely out of place in the game. Definitely not worth the hype and most definitely not worth your time and money.",4,PLAYSTATION 5

"Oh, Sony, once again you've managed to disappoint with another franchise. The difficulty level in this game is nothing short of a joke. Navigating the open world feels like a chore, riddled with frustrating elements like a lot of loading gates and awkward wall huggings that strip away any enjoyment (fast travel is a joke, by the way). The story falls into the realms of B-movie mediocrity. On the positive side, the graphics are commendable, and the plethora of settings in the menu adds a layer of customization. Thankfully, I didn't shell out the full price for this experience, and that's the only silver lining.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game, this is an all-time great, and will leave a lasting impression. The story of God of War Ragnarok is nothing short of epic. It strikes a perfect balance, avoiding excessive drama while still providing ample room for character development. The integration of side quests into the main narrative is seamless, enhancing the overall experience and immersing players in a rich world. From a technical standpoint, the game is a marvel. The rock-solid 60fps frame rate ensures smooth gameplay, and the stunning graphics, even in performance mode, showcase the game's visual prowess. It's a treat for the eyes, which further enhances the immersive nature of the game. The soundtrack and voice acting in God of War Ragnarok are top-notch. The serious tone of the music and the performances successfully elicit emotional responses and keep your heart racing throughout the game. The balance struck between intensity and believability is remarkable. There were a few drawbacks, however. The combat system, in particular, seemed to try too hard to emulate the style of Souls games. It placed heavy emphasis on pattern recognition and punished players for not immediately knowing an enemy's attack patterns. Once you familiarize yourself with these patterns though, the challenge decreases significantly, often rendering bosses ineffective against an experienced player. Overall God of War Ragnarok delivers an exceptional gaming experience. The engaging story, technical excellence, and captivating audio elements make it a truly memorable adventure. Although the combat system may have its drawbacks, it doesn't detract significantly from the overall enjoyment of the game. I highly recommend God of War Ragnarok to anyone seeking an epic and immersive experience.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"After playing God of War 4 in 2018, it instantly became one of my favourite games I had ever played. For this reason, along with the final cutscene teasing a conflict with Thor, I was very excited for a sequel. After 43 hours, I finally finished GoW:R in April of 2024 (I was late to the party this time, yes). I'm happy to say it met my expectations and definitely did not disappoint. The good: The highlights were the stellar, jaw-dropping, bar-raising, graphics and environment detail/composition, as well as the gripping story coursing through the veins of the game's grandiose cutscenes. Ragnarok produces many memorable moments, just as its predecessor did. The combat feels visceral and impactful. It is familiar to returning players, while making a few adjustments and adding a new cool weapon. They also seem to have listened to the complaints concerning enemy/boss variety, as this time around there are many more boss types. An underrated aspect of God of War in my opinion is the voice acting, firstly, its great that many voice actors returned to the recording booths for this one, and secondly, the voice actors of Brok, Thor, Mimir, and Kratos are just so damned talented and memorable! Truly I love so many of them, I must give praise where it is due, Santa Monica have an eye for hiring unique and fitting voice actors. It's up there with the uncharted and red dead series for me. The same can be said about the story, this series and kratos' progression is legendary in video games for me, one of the best, most iconic, fleshed out stories. What could have been improved: While GoW: Ragnarok is great, there are a many remarks i'd like to make. No game is perfect, here are some things that slightly bothered me during my playthrough: I feel like you can't zoom in on the map enough. Secondly, although the combat felt great, I personally felt like Atreus was a little stiff in a literal sense and in terms of what he can do in the players' hands, and despite a third new, cool weapon, it added a layer of uncertainty whenever I picked a weapon (will I equip the one I want? and will this one be the most effective?). It should have been made more clear which weapons are more effective against which enemies. And while the combat is gory, and, as I have said before, visceral, it seems counter productive and looks underwhelming to have enemies immediately transform into leaves and vanish. Frankly, I struggle to rationalise the choice: It takes away from the gore, I doubt it was for memory/processing reasons, and potentially it could have been due to the will to not obstruct gameplay, but I can think of many ways to reduce such problems besides just making the vanquished vanish. look, I just think the timing and visuals are unbefitting. However, in all honesty, it is not a big deal. Furthermore, some faces seemed a bit uncanny (like Atreus and Freya) and out of place in what is otherwise an impeccable looking game. ragnarok was kind of underwhelming for me, maybe a bit more footage of the wolves and close ups of the Thor vs Jormungandr fight and odin's pov while all the chaos is happening and his emotions and preparation and a cool shot of asgard's soldiers all lined up and advancing, I mean there was so much more they could have added to make it more epic and memorable, cuz all i remember was seeing the rogue valkyries flying towards the walls of Asgard and Jörmungandr in the distance and Fenrir making a brief appearance in front of me/kratos & Atreus... I'm not sure why it was so important to focus on the protagonists during the whole war. Freyr and freya's involvement felt kinda supressed... What I disliked: For some reason, I was really struggling at times with staying focused on the world, with how close to the camera kratos was. I wish there was a FOV/camera distance slider in the settings. My second and final real complaint is how interruptive Atreus tends to be during puzzle-solving moments. I'm only realising now that it only got better in the second half because there were less puzzles, perhaps because I was focusing more on the Story and finishing the game, or it was by design, bizarrely. Conclusion: Despite my criticisms, it is a dream sequel. builds upon the first, and the first was already a masterpiece. The characters evolve even more, the story and characters are flesh out even more, and the same can be said about the gameplay and graphics. As fun, memorable, emotional, gory, mythical and nordic as ever. They listened to the criticisms, enemies are more varied. lacking skill tree n camera felt too zoomed in and a lot of immersion breaking lines. the camera is unsettlingly close. I don't remember have issues with the previous entry, but this time I really wished there were FOV/camera distance options. Also, enemies turning into leaves is anti-climactic and counter-productive. I give GoW:R an 87/100.",8,PLAYSTATION 5

Turning the legendary franchise to a marvel movie and rushing the ending as well playing nanny most of the time was irritating and annoying for the whole games time,5,PLAYSTATION 5
"Builds upon an excellent formula. Script and story very compelling, gameplay fantastic. The skill names and importance of certain stats (e.g. luck) could be easier to follow for general users.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"An improvement over the 2018 game in every sense. The realms are awesome to explore, however, to get the most out of it, one must beat the story first to get access to every tool.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
How Is game didn’t got game of the year shocking this is best game in 2022 it’s so fun,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"This is one of the best games I ever played and I am not exaggerating. The gameplay is better than the previous god of war and it’s a masterpiece along side with the graphics and the world ( the realms ) were beautiful. Robbed from game of the year for me. A little shout out to the end credit song “ blood upon the snow” by Hozier ,Bear McCreary it was amazing and suits the game very well",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Good sequel with great improvements to the combat system but, camera was awful than the previous during combat. Too much climbing and crawling that kill game pacing. Story was a little disapointment it was too safe everything runs almost perfect, no big challenges for kratos and atreus, they have some struggles but, they will overcome it easily and quickly. GOW Ragnarok is good and fun game with brilliant graphics and beautiful art direction but, its story was wasted potential.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Ragnarok is an incredible, emotional and captivating adventure, with dramatic moments in the story, although it also contains intense action, to the point that we will question whether the work is a movie or a video game for real, everything is perfect, thanks to the excellent director’s cut and actors staging: we have brilliant cinematics. Being in this way a great sequel, providing one of the best games of the entire saga, culminating its story. Ragnarok manages to surpass his predecessor in many aspects, the level designs were totally improved, leaving behind the typical linear paths, thus expanding its borders, now with much larger and open areas (very extensive by the way) full of platforms and verticality. Exploration is another strength, since now we have a lot of secondary content with great quality, as interesting as if it were the same main adventure. The combat within the gameplay are improved points, now with a greater amount of skills and weaponry we will be able to face greater numbers of enemies, all varied in designs, with excellent AI, providing a fresh air and leaving behind the repetition of the same enemy changing in color. Special mention to the brilliant level bosses, now we will find much more, with their own strategies and moments that will take our breath away, giving us long fights and extraordinary sequences. The music maintains the same size as its predecessor, a high quality level, each area with its particular rhythm, enveloping tones and creating a great atmosphere, recreating the ideal momentum. In summary, there is a lot of continuity in this GOW Ragnarok, it is very conservative in many aspects, but thanks to the expansion of its mapping, it offers greater depth in its missions and quests, providing a much improved exploration or rewards, all this makes feels it is a more complete product in global content than its predecessor. Graphically a wonder, pure art and horse power muscle, squeezing the qualities of the console to the edge, great performance! I am ready for the next chapter!",10,PLAYSTATION 5
No other words except that this is a full blown masterpiece. Left me speechless and is one of my top 10 favorite games of all time.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarok delivers a thrilling mix of intense action and mind-challenging puzzles. The engaging storyline continues the saga of Kratos and Atreus, weaving seamlessly through Norse mythology with meticulous detail. The violent and fun battles showcase Kratos' raw power while introducing new, rewarding mechanics. As a worthy sequel, Ragnarok not only builds upon its predecessor's strengths but also evolves the franchise, making it a must-play for both fans and newcomers.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Niestety zawód straszny może na początku gra przybiera właściwego tempa i mamy wrażenie że zaraz się rozkręci. Niestety z każdą godziną jest coraz gorzej jednym słowem NUDA , historia nie porywa ani trochę na tyle żeby siedzieć z zaciekawieniem co dalej ? Wątek rozmywa się w trakcie gry niczym woda w kiblu. I tak idziemy po kolejnych krainach a to uratować kogoś , zebrać kamyczki bo coś tam, szukamy Frei i jesteśmy skazani na 4 godzinne biadolenie jak to jest jej ciężko. Wątki z Atreusem kompletnie nic nie wnoszą , latamy po dżungli z króla lwa zbieramy jabłka aby wkurzyć babcie poznanej właśnie koleżanki po co ? Nie wiadomo ale 2 godziny wyjęte z gry. Tak naprawdę nikt nie wie czego chce w tej grze i właściwie dokąd idziemy po prostu idziemy wracamy i dalej wiesz tyle co na początku. Dopiero pod końcówka gra przybiera właściwy tor. Oczywiście w trakcie przemierzania różnych krain i zabijania setki nijakich wrogów dialogi i jeszcze raz dialogi z których tak naprawdę nic nie wynika aby popierdolić dyrdymały nic nie wnoszące do gry. Mimir będzie nam przygadywal z tyłu niczym Karol Strasburger i po paru godzinach mamy ochotę wyrzucić ten łeb w przepaść. Mechanicznie również sama walka staje się po paru godzinach mega powtarzalna i brak tej czystej radochy z budowania swojego drzewka umiejętności. Czasem miałem wrażenie że nasze nawet najmocniejsze ciosy nie robiły wrażenia na słabych przeciwnikach , potrafili w miedzy czasie wystosować swój potężny cios jak gdyby nigdy nic. Podsumowując jeżeli chcesz iść na baaardzo długi denny spacer po krainach mitologii nordyckiej oraz słuchać infantylnych do bólu dialogów których Moda na Sukces by się nie powstydzila jak najbardziej polecam. Jeżeli szukasz mocnego Kratosa i nagłych zwrotów akcji które wystrzelą cię z fotela to nie ten adres. Jedyne co trzeba oddać to oprawa graficzna bo jest 10/10 po prostu majstersztyk , Muzyka również ale niestety mordy naszych bohaterów nigdy nie milkną i nie ma czasu na wczucie się w klimat musisz słuchać zbędnego pierdolenia. Także ogólnie słabizna bo spodziewałem się ciekawej historii a nie rozwleczonego makaronu w którym wszystko jest nijakie.",4,PLAYSTATION 5
"An evolution, but only in technical matters The 2018 God of War was a game that really affected me, I was a fan of the franchise before, but I wasn't that much of a fan, after the fourth game I went crazy about this game, it was incredible, the story, the graphics, the ost , everything, so I was expecting great things from this one, but it didn't deliver as much as I expected. On the technical side I have nothing to complain about, just praise, what a beautiful game, it has evolved a lot from what was already good, the gameplay is much more satisfying and fluid, many more enemies, other completely different kingdoms and the old ones have also been reworked, You can see how much effort they put into it and how much care they had when they were producing this game. But not everything is rosy, the story took a nosedive and the further it went, the more it fell. It's kind of sad to say this, but it needs to be said, this game has a more epic feel compared to its predecessor, trying to make you vibrate and say: ""I've been waiting for this"", but that's it, the logical sense and the game's coherence fails a lot, it seems like they worried a lot about how badass it would be and didn't worry about how well written it is, some things happen very quickly, others take much longer than they should, the side-quests that in the previous one I I thought they were fun, they didn't catch my attention in this one, I did at most about 4 of them, the new characters are not as interesting as the old ones and are very little developed, the boss fights are well done, but there are so many of them in the game that some of them were supposed to be more important or more epic and are left aside. Despite all this, I highly recommend this game, especially if you like the franchise, or if you liked the previous one, it made me cry, vibrate, scream, jump, get emotional and if you play it, I bet you'll feel the same",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"As good as the first one. building off of the fantastic moments of 2018, this game once again brings another fantastic story and great characters. The big fights of the game are always a great spectacle to play. Hope this helps",10,PLAYSTATION 5

"God of War Ragnarok is an Action-Adventure game and it came out in 9 November 2022 for consoles (Ps4) and (Ps5). The game refers about the adventure of two main characters, which are the protagonists of the game Kratos(father) and Atreas(son) after the God of War (2018), where they are still trying to survive but now the fimbulwinter where it has arrived after the death of Baldur. On the other hand, Kratos is trying to protect his son again, as every father does from very dangerous monsters and hostile gods that are threats to his son, but he is not seeking for war and vengeance like he did when he was young and trying to avoid any possible conflict with gods through their adventure. Moreover, the narration of the game is incredibly emotional with it's own shocking and exciting moments, apart from this every character has it's own shocking character development with a lot of upheavals and suspicions, as well as it gives a powerful variety of emotions and how their development and their choices impacts their own future and other gods future. The technical field of the game ensures it's settings very well with a huge impact on perfomance and quality, however we can also mention about the audio of the game and how all of it's components connected together to make the best possible experience for the player, for example every character has it's own theme, and also how precised they have made sound effects for action moments and emotional and all of that. Now, I want to say a few things about the mechanics of the game and how they are using them in order to make the game more difficult for the player. First of all, it has different difficulty modes like for players that want to experience just the story of the game, another mode with slight focus on combat and two more modes that are for more experienced God of War players. Also, it's character has different capabilities and abilities on it's own skill tree, where you can modify your own action moves, and you can add different runes like on an RPG game to upgrade all of your armor and weapons. That was my review about that game and how I felt everything that were happening on that game. I have really enjoyed the game from the first minute to the last minute of the game, because I have played the previous god of war and I was really waited for the next one so long.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"A VERY Good game and story as a whole, loves that its build on the foundation that was set back in 2018, and I adore Kratos character development over the years. The only down side to this was the name of the game. Being call ""Ragnaorok"" the Actual event (twilight of the gods) was not as ""All Hell Break Lose"" as it should have been, It was not bad or disappointing quite the opposite actually but rather it feels really underwhelming.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"It shows that Gow is no longer what it was before, he has lost his magic of yesteryear",1,PLAYSTATION 5
"Very good story, the controls are a why and swimming, **** in executing the commands.",5,PLAYSTATION 5
"The story is interesting, the movement of combat is quite good, the armor is pretty.The enemies are strong, quickly, the bosses are imposing, but I believe when we control atreus in jothuneim the missions is not interesting and harvesting fruit does not interest me.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"While God of War isn't my favorite game this was still really good as it did a great job with the characters especially Kratos giving him more development and the story in this game was pretty good with nice ost, good looking graphics, good story and the combat Is great as always with the GoW game",8,PLAYSTATION 5

"A great sequel to God of war (2018). The story is significantly longer than GOW4 but keep you excited through out your playthrough. It's a mixture. Some part have to pumped up and excited. Some part even make you burst out into tears with the acting of the characters. The combat is basically GOW4 nothing feels that different from it other than more combos and stuff and new enemy type. The only flaw is exploration in my opinion. Some realm has literally nothing to explore which is really weird as Santa Monica said we will get to explore the nine realms. I played this game on both version (PS4, PS5). The PS4 version is of course 30 fps as usual and actually managed to run at a stable framerate. I've only experienced frame rate drops twice during my playthrough. I highly recommend playing this game on the PS5 but if you don't have the system then you can stick to PS4",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Simply the good war kleitão, I don't need to talk anymore, I will talk more about 75 character, that's it!",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I absolutely loved this game, it builds on Kratos’ character more and beautifully builds on his character further. It build and expands on everything its previous instalment did and by doing so made everything better. Atreus is his own character and it opens the door for more possibilities in the franchise and there is satisfaction within his character in the story. The gameplay is amazing, combat has never felt so challenging in previous instalments and the bosses are the best in the franchise. The variety of armour, weapons and abilities makes combat so immersive and unique to your own play style. The story is amazing and the graphics are some of the best at this very moment. Kratos has the best face model in gaming history at the moment closely followed by Aloy in the Horizon franchise. The voice acting and performances are amazing and it’s understandable why Christopher Judge got the award for best performance back in The Game Awards. New faces in God of War’s story definitely felt memorable and satisfying, Scott Porter’s Heimdall was a personal favourite of mine and was one of the best characters in the game. There is very little to complain about when it comes to the game other than its few linear levels which felt a little tedious. The story has a slow pace to continue with its cinematic feel so it shouldn’t be rushed and you should be patient with the game. I love this game but it’s a bit sad this decreases it replay ability but nonetheless I still love this game for that. Although this may sound contradicting I think the lack of replay ability is a good thing since it simply avoids the game being too repetitive since as a person who platinumed the game and 100% every single realm, it does become very tedious over time and although exploration is amazing it’s still repetitive going place to place. Another small complaint I had was that when playing new game plus, the game thinks that you don’t have the spear and blades and therefore cinematic scenes had Kratos picking up literally nothing and blowing up rocks with the spear or throwing the spear in necessary areas isn’t possible until when the game thinks you get it. These are just small complaints however and it didn’t ruin my experience that much. Overall the game is masterful although it’s tiny nitpicks did make the game that bit tedious.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
Deze GOW is beter dan die ervoor met name de combat en levels zijn gevarieerder dat wat ik miste in GOW 2018. En ook de speelduur is vrij lang met alle zijmissies die erin zitten. Ik zou iedereen deze game aan raden. Top game!!!!!,9,PLAYSTATION 5

"This game had a Great story, great music, great pacing, difficulty and style altogether. It only felt a little bit boring when it came at the beginning having to use Atreus. Other than that, I had a great time with this one :D",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The main problems of the game are - Regional nonsense, there are certain voices in one country, but not in another, and if you don’t know English you won’t be able to play the game. There are games that don’t even have translations in the form of subtitles. I don’t understand how the PlayStation hasn’t gone bankrupt yet. Before you buy a game in the PS store, check whether there is a translation with voice acting in your country, which region your country belongs to according to the stupid logic of the PS store and their stupid greedy developers. Horrible people, torturing people like this with their voiceovers. I hope you go bankrupt and normal people replace you. That is, voice acting exists. For example, there is Italian voice acting (hypothetical). But in Italy it is not. In Italy they give Spanish with English, in Spain they give Italian, it’s complete absurdity. There are also people who know Italian, but do not live in Italy, why can’t they play in Italian?? Why do you care, developers? After all, there is voice acting, give it to everyone, you’ve already paid for it, what’s the point of keeping it in a box and giving it only to one country where, by the way, they speak a completely different language. I gave an example with Italian voice acting, but there are many such examples. There is no feeling of God, all ordinary people, ordinary locations, Kratos is weak and again he has no skills, again you need to go through the whole game to make the gameplay interesting, the gameplay solutions are very poor - you just run and hit monsters from Wunschpunsch, the difficulty of the game is too high - i played on easy difficulty so as not to die, in contrast to the interesting worlds, scales and game mechanics and game solutions of the first and second parts. The creators tried to variegate the gameplay, but this attempt is very rarely manifested in the game. There are a lot of interesting side quests, but the game mechanics are boring and I don't feel like doing them. The main advantages of the game - A very exciting, interesting, deep and spiritual plot. Characters, graphics, physics and all the technical parts - very high quality. The plot and dialogues are the best that I know. Unlike the fourth (2018), in which there was very little plot. I hope the developers will stop making the game more boring, the characters weak, boring children's cartoon monsters - even in the final battles the fight is with Wunschpunsch monsters, and stupid restrictions, for example, God of War Kratos cannot jump 2 meters, etc. very implausible solutions. So that they stop making the God of War the Prince of Persia, and Spider-Man the Fool-Wimp Man. My rating is high only because of such an extremely masterpiece plot and the technical implementation of game mechanics, graphics - optimization and sound. In addition, the gameplay is not what we would like and not what should be in this game, but it is still good, especially on NG+, and the technical aspects are well implemented. Also, Kratos is not a character who can be forgiven for his sins. A psychotic mass murderer is not forgiven. The same nonsense in Spider-Man 2.",6,PLAYSTATION 5

"I have played all God of War games from PS2 to PS4; I loved the Greek Sagas. One of the best things about the Greek Sagas was its gameplay, which was really a ""hack and slash"" game. Their story was fascinating. Even its prequel, ""Ascension,"" was fun. I don't mean ""Gow:Ragnarök"" is a bad game; I think the overall is good. The game is entertaining, but only that, except for the Atreus episode (which is really boring). The beginning is fun, but the rest of the game, in my opinion, is repetitive. Only two side quests are worth it. The main story is solid, but it just focuses on Atreus and Kratos and not on ""The Ragnarök."" I just hoped for a really huge, epic battle, but it wasn't what I expected. The gameplay is better than the previous game. The boss battle only with ""Thor"" the first time was great; the rest of the battle from the main story was good but not excellent. My final score is 7/10.",8,PLAYSTATION 5

"Played the first game on release and fell in love with it. Love the the story, the characters and the enviroment. The reason I give this rating is purely because of combat. IT IS THE WORST SOULSLIKE COMBAT I EVER HAD TO ENDURE: The bosses (especially the berserkers) time their strikes so that when you roll, they can sometimes catch in the middle of the roll with a second attack, thus hitting you regardless. If you try the unblockable but parriebale attacks, you guaranteed to get stunned and hit (if you play the 2 hardest difficulties, it is instant death 99% of the time). For some reason you thought that gang boss fights can be done well. Wrong, you **** it up just like everyone else. I am honestly so **** angry with the combat of this game that I went from going for that sweet 100% completeion to just finish the **** game please. Greatest disappointment in gamingin the last decade. I dont mind difficult games and fights, especially when they are optional. Played every single dark souls game at least twice, including sekiro and Elden ring, so no, I am used to difficult games. The is a fine difference between highly challenging and just badly designed and Ragnarok is deffinitely closer to the latter. Challenges should intrigue the player, make him go beyond his normal skillset. You should feel a little angry, frustrated, but you should feel like you can do this, you should know what you do bad and what can be done better. Here? None of that. The only thing I feel after trying a Berserker for 57 **** TIMES, is anger, frustration and just want to kill somebody. Actually managed to destroy the only controler I have, 2 weeks after buying the console. So yea, if you dont intend on playing ANY of the more challenging content, you will deffinitely enjoy yourself with this game. Otherwise, dont even **** consider buying this trash.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

A long and confusing plot, in which over time you begin to get confused, drawn out dialogues, boring relationships between father and son, many inexpressive characters. Looks like some of them came from Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, but not from ancient legends. I wanted action and fighting, but got dialogs and endless puzzles. With this part, the whole series completely died for me and I no longer want to have anything to do with that. What is really great in this game is level details and music!

"My biggest problem with this game is that I expected more, although I enjoyed the story of Kratos and Domen I consider that it did not live up to expectations.Visually it is a very beautiful game, of performance it is very good and the combat is that of the previous but expanded.He fixes one of the biggest problems (in my opinion) of the previous one that was the variety of enemies and others but now I have noticed many others that perhaps were also in the previous installment.The rhythm is generally slow, sometimes too slow, almost all the action is concentrated at the end and the most anticipated fights at all meet the expectations or at the playable or visual level.While the game as such was very good, I assumed that I would impact as much as the 3 in its day and that it would have as much action and variety as the previous deliveries since they would have to ""only"" had to expand the above.",7,PLAYSTATION 5
"Score: 9,5 One of the best, if not the best game I've ever played. Gameplay, characters, story, soundtrack, animation/presantation, open world areas and graphics are on another level. The game almost improved in every aspect compared to God of War 2019. The only thing I would have liked better would have been fast traveling from the map.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"the worst gameplay-wise, this game feels mediocre and rushed, Sony disappointing the community, unfortunately there will be those who defend this crap because we only had one game this year",0,PLAYSTATION 5

One of the greatest sequels and game overall ever made!,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War Ragnarok is a magnificent sequel that addresses many of the weaknesses of its predecessor. Notably, it has significantly expanded the variety of enemies and introduced epic boss battles that enhance the overall gaming experience. The quality of side activities has seen an improvement, although there are still some rather inconsequential ""spirit quests"" that could have been omitted. Even after completing the main story, there is ample post-credits content and challenges to engage players who crave more. The optional foes provide a satisfying level of challenge and enjoyment. However, the hunting of ravens could have been omitted without detriment.From a narrative perspective, the game is a success. The plot is exciting and emotionally engaging, and the characters are interesting with their motivations being easily understandable. All in all, it offers a magnificent gaming experience that stands out. I'm eager to see how the future unfolds for our father-son duo.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarök is a worthy successor to the 2018 masterpiece. The game delivers a similarly thrilling experience, with Kratos and Atreus continuing their epic journey. The platinum trophy is as fantastic as its predecessor, challenging yet rewarding for completionists. The Steinbjorn armor is the best, proving its worth countless times in tough battles. The heartwarming ending ties up the saga beautifully, leaving a lasting impression. Beyond the main story, there's an abundance of post-game content, ensuring you won't want to put it down. It's so beautifully crafted that even after achieving the platinum, I couldn't resist starting a New Game+ to experience the 100% walkthrough all over again. Overall, ""God of War: Ragnarök"" earns a perfect 10/10. It's a remarkable achievement in gaming, delivering an unforgettable adventure that lives up to its predecessor's legacy. The combination of storytelling, visuals, and gameplay makes it an essential experience for any gamer.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

Majestic once again Santa Monica Studios demonstrates the magic they know how to do.,9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Another great game in a great series. However, I wasn't as impressed with the combat mechanics and experience as I was with the previous installments, and I still didn't find the maps to be as accessible as they were in the previous installments, so that didn't add much depth to the game.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
Bad story and beat gameplay.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
"I've never played a game as good as this, honestly! A must buy for all PlayStation owners and the cinematics are nothing like you'll experience in any game. The developers did this sequel a great service and once you've completed it you'll need a moment to absorb everything in and any game you play thereafter will feel inferior.",10,PLAYSTATION 5

this game and its mythology are insane,9,PLAYSTATION 5
Just one word. MASTERPIECE!!! Game Play: The game put you in action all the time. No boaring for even a second. Grafics: Grafics are wonder. It's masterpiece of games's developmente.,10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The definitive reboot of the God of War experience. Huge world, satisfying gameplay and an epic story with great characters - specially the villains. A must play, although I'd strongly recommend first to complete the 2018 prequel.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"Great game.Artwork.Music, game design, heroes, plot, epic ending.At the level of emotions 10/10.Incredible immersion due to a huge number of kat of scenes, epic episodes.You emphasize the hero, shaking in this part at some prohibitive level.The scriptwriters perfectly weaved the history of the Greek Kratos into Scandinavian mythology, this part is a direct continuation of the previous one, the completed dilogy.The gameplay aspects flowed from the last part, added new weapons, new bumps.But closer to the end of the game on average it becomes easy to play, only the berserkers give Chelendge.The plot bosses also easily passed.The music in the game is worthy of a separate award.There are epic orchestral themes and no less spectacular folk motives.The game has many different locations and opponents, added new flying enemies, phantoms, various creatures, with each their own tactics.The Side of History is quite interesting, the world of Vanya is huge, on the statement of all the questions I spent 6-8 hours.Of the shortcomings, I would sometimes note the unobvious ways on the levels, I had to watch the passage on YouTube several times.I really took a quest with a dragon, where it was necessary to raise a cage with the animal inside, I first thought it was a bug, that these dogs would constantly respond and run to the cage in general you will find a fascinating story for 20+ hours, if you want to dust everything, then get ready for 30-40 hours.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"The gameplay of God of War: Ragnarok revolves around a combination of intense combat, puzzle-solving, and world exploration. Players have the opportunity to enhance and unlock new skills, allowing them to customize Kratos' combat style and adapt to different situations. With a variety of enemies ranging from mythical creatures to powerful gods, it culminates the entire saga into something incredible.",9,PLAYSTATION 5
"After 4 years waiting to return to Vera Kratos and Domen return in a game that does not disappoint anyone, the Nordic adventure continues and cries, laugh and angry with the end of this emotional story and an almost insurmountable gameplay.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"I thought improving upon the brilliant first part was impossible. How wrong was I... Almost every part of the game touched for the better. Touching and grand story, slick and impactful gameplay mechanics, Jaw dropping scenery and graphics. Perfect 10.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"This game is a masterpiece, it has really improved from every aspect compared to God of war 2018.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Easily one of the best games I've ever played. The amount of content (of any kinds) this game offers in comparison to the 2018's is INSANE! Of course, plenty of people disagree for relying blindly on absurdly impossible expectations, or because they tend to stay in the past (specifically, Greece), or because they believe the only thing that makes this game what it is... is the yellow objective marker ""The Path"". There simply is NO judging this game without reaching everywhere, in every realm, (perhaps even completing 100% of it). Great work, Santa Monica Studios.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"An absolutely incredible game,story and cast of characters that bring it all together for a masterpiece. SSM should be extremely proud.",10,PLAYSTATION 5
"Amazing story, characters, world design, lore, character interactions and dynamics, dialogue, graphics, boss fights and combat, and builds off from the previous game really well both narratively and thematically. And despite all that perfection, they included absolutely diabolical enemy health. Like genuinely, this game has great combat and you see it in full effect during the amazing boss fights, but my god, NOBODY wants to fight against unending waves of enemies with absurd health/defence. Every part of a quest is broken up by 10 hordes of the same enemies attacking you, over and over. And the thing is, it's not fun, but its not really challenging either, its just unbelievably time consuming and agitating.",9,PLAYSTATION 5

"The game did take a lot of aspects from the first one but it also improved on it drastically, I'm talking more fluid combat with an additional weapon I won't say what it is, more armor that I feel is improved from the first game, phenomenal graphics even better than red dead redemption and the tomb raider games and a more emotional and groundbreaking story 10/10 perfect",10,PLAYSTATION 5
The best way to spoil a good franchise.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
"A game that failed to deliver in almost every aspect, besides having some of the most boring traversal sequences in modern games the story always surprise you with unexpected turns, which should be fun except every single of this surprising turns is even boring that what you initially were waiting for, take as an example meeting Thor the God of Thunder! Well he's just a drunk and the boss fight are very easy and forgettable, oh you will be finally meeting 'Tyr' the Nordic God of war well he's a pacifist with ptsd, and by the way he's just a bad written joke, this are just two of the many development ideas that really hurt the game. Oh sorry I forgot about the Ragnarok mos boring war sequence in modern game era. The enemies are so repetitive the puzzles are bad designed and oh God the whole game felt like a chore I'm just glad I finished. What is good?? Graphics and having an axe that returns to your hand I suppose, that by the way don't have a I improvement over the first game.",2,PLAYSTATION 5

god of war Ragnarok is a must-play game on PS5. the game might feel slow at the starting phases but over time you feel like its one of the best game you have ever played. amazing direction. amazing sound design. amazing **** really emotional,9,PLAYSTATION 5
The Original God of War series is one of my favourite game series of all time. Then after many years first came Gow 2018 which was like Ok but never good. Then this came out. My first question is WHO THE F WANTS TO PLAY WITH THAT BOY!? I couldn't even finish the game it was so bad.. Where is the Anger of Kratos? Where is the whole atmosphere from the original games from background music to TC Carsons much better voice acting. It's almost as bad as changing David Hayter to Kiefer Sutherland as the voice of Snake.,0,PLAYSTATION 5
"It is still good but I feel that it is more of the same, 0.0 of innovation and even bored machaca buttons without mercy and to the gross you will pass it to you.You will pass it to you to 2 times when much and then you will not want to know more about the Pufff !!forgettable.Hmm!!",6,PLAYSTATION 5
"Really good game, puzzles, armors , power ups, fights… but the end was frustrating you only fight actually one strong Aesir god, and two at the same time weak Aesir. You don’t get to visit all the realms , and the game kind make you think that you are going to do so… The end of the main story was all of sudden..",8,PLAYSTATION 5
"God of War: Ragnarok, the highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 masterpiece, continues to shine in both its storytelling and visual prowess. While there haven't been significant changes in graphics or gameplay, I didn't expect any, nor did I necessarily want them. However, in my opinion, the story is expertly extended, and the Ragnarok theme is seamlessly integrated into the world of God of War.I eagerly immersed myself in this epic journey, spending hours on end exploring the world, completing the story, and finishing all the side quests. I was immensely proud to earn the Platinum trophy, a testament to how engrossing the game is. It's a clear recommendation for any aficionado of immersive storytelling.Once again, just like its predecessor, I found myself yearning for even more exploration of the Norse mythology. Therefore, I hold out hope for a DLC that will grant us the opportunity to delve deeper into this rich and captivating **** summary, God of War: Ragnarok is a worthy successor that continues to excel in storytelling and graphics. It offers a compelling and immersive experience that is sure to satisfy fans of the series and anyone who loves a good story. Here's to hoping for more adventures.",8,PLAYSTATION 5
